0
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,910
Okay, so we're almost done with
conditionals.

1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,740
I want to show you one more kind of
conditional.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,780
It's a little bit different.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,308
It's not a bit of code structure
that you make, it is,

4
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:19,621
it is dealing with the fact that some
things may blow up.

5
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:23,395
Like, if you read a number from a user and
you try to convert it

6
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:25,763
to a floating point number, as you may

7
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:28,797
have already done in some of your
homework,

8
00:00:28,797 --> 00:00:29,764
it can blow up.

9
00:00:29,764 --> 00:00:35,060
You know it's going to blow up, but you
don't exactly want it to kill your program.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:40,430
So, the concept of try and except are,
hey, this is a dangerous thing.

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,430
I know it might blow up.

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,531
I know exactly what it might blow up, but
I don't want to die

13
00:00:43,531 --> 00:00:45,990
I don't want to stop my program
when it blows up.

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,260
I want to continue.

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,690
And that's the purpose of the except
block.

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,520
So, here's a little bit of code.

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,210
And, you know, it's, we've done
this code before.

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,880
This is code that's kind of
similar to, like

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,850
your rate and pay homework, where
you read a string

20
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,710
using raw input, you converted it using
float, but

21
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,950
then if you typed in Fred, the
thing blows up.

22
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,190
So we're kind of simulating that
right here.

23
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,080
So here we have a variable astr
called Hello Bob,

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,580
and then we try to turn it into an
integer.

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,370
And then we're going to print that out,
and then we have

26
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,920
another string called one, and that has
the letters 1, 2, 3.

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,580
We convert that to an integer, and then we
print that one out.

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,600
The problem is, is that when this runs,

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,020
this is going to fail.

30
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,450
It's going to fail with this traceback,
okay?

31
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,240
And the problem is, is when the traceback
happens, the program stops executing.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,330
The traceback is Python's way of asking
you, hey, this

33
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,330
would be bad, I don't know what to do,
I'm stopping.

34
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,478
So that means that the rest of your
program is gone, right?

35
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:53,682
It,

36
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:56,700
The fact that we had stuff down here
doesn't matter.

37
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,700
This line died with the traceback.

38
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,790
It stopped.

39
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,550
It doesn't, like, give you a traceback and
then keep going.

40
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:06,661
It gives you a traceback, and
that's the end.

41
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,293
Now this might be something, instead of

42
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:11,060
just the string, Hello Bob, which is
insane.

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,530
Data might have come from a raw input,
where the user was typing, and you say,

44
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,450
give me a number, and they type something

45
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,650
that's not a number, and this would
blow up.

46
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,210
It's like, hey, I know it's going to
blow up.

47
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:26,613
The problem with this is that you don't,
oops, erp, clear the thing.

48
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,403
Oh and now we have to start it on fire again.

49
00:02:29,403 --> 00:02:30,964
Okay, it's on fire.

50
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:34,550
The problem is, is that in a sense, this
program is you.

51
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,970
If you recall, we have you as the, typing
these commands

52
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,010
into these scripts, feeding the central
processing unit, answering the question

53
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,430
what next?

54
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,320
So you should take it a little personally
when your program gets a traceback.

55
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,180
because that means you, in the form of
your program, have been vaporized.

56
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,870
And you're not present to give any more
instructions.

57
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,620
It stops.

58
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,450
It stops dead in its tracks.
You are gone.

59
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,350
So, we want to make sure we control this
behavior.

60
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,790
We know it might blow up,

61
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,600
and we want to capture the situation where
it does, and execute alternate code.

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,580
Okay.

63
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,120
So here it goes.

64
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,780
It's a bit of syntax.

65
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,230
I mentioned that it uses the try and
except keywords.

66
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,560
These are reserved words in Python.
And then it's a little indented block.

67
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,390
So, astr equals Hello Bob, great.

68
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,010
Try means, we're about to do something
dangerous, let's take out some

69
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,490
insurance policy on it.

70
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:39,420
And that is, we're going to convert this
to an integer.

71
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,830
Take astr, convert it to an integer, put
it in istr.

72
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,430
If that works, great, we'll just continue
on, and ignore this except.

73
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,415
If it blows up, we're going to jump into
the

74
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:54,220
except block, and then we'll have
alternate substitute code.

75
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,330
In this case, I'm going to set the
variable to negative 1 as an indicator.

76
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,800
Then I'll print it out, and I'll do it
again.

77
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,860
Try this code, and away we go.

78
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,578
So, when this runs, we know exactly how
it's going to run.

79
00:04:08,578 --> 00:04:14,516
It, whoa, woop, come back.

80
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:18,284
We'll set this string, the try
takes out the insurance,

81
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:24,846
this blows up, so it runs down to here
and runs this part, and then it'll

82
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:30,300
print First minus 1.
And it sets the string to 1, 2, 3, not

83
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,788
123, but 1, 2, 3 as a string.
It takes out an insurance policy.

84
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:40,835
This time it works, and that puts
istr is going to be 123,

85
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:45,191
so we don't run the accept code, and
so out comes the

86
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:50,969
second 1, 2, 3, okay?
So the try is, take out insurance on this

87
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:54,097
little bit of code, and if it fails,

88
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:58,563
run this alternate code. If not, skip the
alternate code.

89
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:00,079
So it's kind of conditional.

90
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,499
If you put multiple lines in the block
between

91
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:07,530
the try and the except, it runs until one
dies.

92
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,080
So it doesn't come back, okay?

93
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,430
It's not taking insurance out on,
separately, on all three statements.

94
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,690
It's like, here's a block of stuff, and if
anything blows up,

95
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,870
stop.
And the things that run do run.

96
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,078
So if, this is really kind of bad code,

97
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:25,010
because you really don't want
the print in here.

98
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,350
It's actually a good idea on the try
except to have as little in the

99
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,300
try block as you possibly can, so you're
real clear on what's going to fail.

100
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:38,530
but, so here we come in, shh, it's Bob,
so it's going to fail.

101
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,400
We run this.

102
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,170
That runs successfully.

103
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,540
This blows up, so it quits and jumps into
the except blocks and continues.

104
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,231
The point is, is that this code never
executes, never executes.

105
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:54,380
The other point is, this code does
execute.

106
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,094
Just because this blew up, this is already
executed,

107
00:05:57,094 --> 00:05:59,808
it might have done something other, more
complex than

108
00:05:59,808 --> 00:06:03,280
print Hello, okay?
So, so there you go.

109
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,410
So, if we look at this kind of in a
picture,

110
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,494
we, we set this through the try block, it
runs, it runs.

111
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:14,479
And the, the try except kind of has this
escape hatch that says, if there is

112
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,089
a [SOUND] explosion somehow, then
it runs this

113
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:22,622
alternate code and then it comes out and
finishes, okay?

114
00:06:22,622 --> 00:06:24,872
And, again, this, it doesn't go

115
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:29,767
back and finish the block, and it doesn't
undo the work that is done by that.

116
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:32,170
So it doesn't un-execute it.

117
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:34,850
If it executes and works, it just keeps on
going, then

118
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,790
it blows up, and then sort of flushes its
way out, okay?

119
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,130
So here's an example of how you might do
this in a running program, like the

120
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,980
programs that you're about to be assigned,
where

121
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,710
you're supposed to check for user input
having errors.

122
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:56,020
So, here is a little conversion of a
number, and

123
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,430
and so we're saying, you know, enter a number,
and we're putting a string into rawstr.

124
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,260
It's a string, and and so, we don't know.

125
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,460
And here's where we're going to convert it
into an integer,

126
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,348
and we're just not sure if it's going to
work or not.

127
00:07:09,348 --> 00:07:14,758
So, we know how int works. It either
converts it or it blows up.

128
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:14,950
So we know

129
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,486
it's going to do that, we just don't

130
00:07:16,486 --> 00:07:18,627
know what the user's going to type, we
don't know.

131
00:07:18,627 --> 00:07:21,439
So we have to take out insurance on it.
So this runs,

132
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,029
and then we do a try, and then we
try to convert it,

133
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:27,137
and if it works, it's great, and if

134
00:07:27,137 --> 00:07:30,370
it fails, it runs this and sets it to
negative 1.

135
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,860
And afterwards, we either have the number
or negative 1.

136
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,200
And so, if the person enters 42,
it says Nice work.

137
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,440
Well, let's show you where it runs.

138
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,664
If the person says 42, it runs through
here, gets the string 42, converts that

139
00:07:47,664 --> 00:07:52,650
to an integer, skips here, and then says,
Nice work, and that's how it runs.

140
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,614
If, on the other hand, they type
forty two, the words,

141
00:07:56,614 --> 00:07:59,820
this gets to be the string forty two.

142
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,940
It runs here, this blows up.

143
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,290
So it comes and runs this part here.

144
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,520
And then it says, if ival is greater than
0, which is not true,

145
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,510
so it runs this part and says
Not a number.

146
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:17,380
So this is our way of compensating for
user input

147
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,300
that might have errors in it, errors that
we're anticipating, right?

148
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:25,210
You'd, you'd rather at least
put up some kind of a

149
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,060
message, rather than just have a
traceback,

150
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,800
if you're writing code for somebody else.

151
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,080
It just kind of is

152
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,719
not very classy. So,

153
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:43,490
the classic program to do this is a
time-and-a-half for overtime pay.

154
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,376
So you get some pay rate like
$10 an hour for your first 40 hours,

155
00:08:49,376 --> 00:08:52,951
and then you get 15 hours, for
any hours above it.

156
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:57,297
So you have to sort of say, oh, okay, if
this ends up being, this ends up being

157
00:08:57,297 --> 00:09:03,273
some kind of a thing, where, let me draw
that picture a little better.

158
00:09:03,273 --> 00:09:06,654
Hours greater than 40, you're going to do
one thing, and

159
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:10,570
if hours are less than 40, you're going to
do another thing.

160
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,800
So you have two payout calculations.

161
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,725
If the hours are greater than 40, then
you're going to do

162
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:21,900
a overtime calculation, which is kind of
like, 40 times the regular rate.

163
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,910
And then, the number of excess hours,
like 5 overtime hours

164
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,620
times the reg, rate times
one-and-a-half.

165
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,560
So this is kind of the calculation that
happens if the hours are greater than 40.

166
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,960
And then, if the hours are less than 40,
it's just pay

167
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,690
equals rate times hours.

168
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,660
So it, you're going to do one of two
calculations, depending on how it works.

169
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:50,720
So that's one of the programming problems
for this chapter.

170
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,330
That's a classic.

171
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,240
It's the classic if, then, else.

172
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,080
You can actually do it with an if, then
if you're tricky.

173
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,462
There's a lot of ways to do this, so pick
a, pick one and do it.

174
00:09:59,462 --> 00:10:04,247
Now the next thing I want you to do is, I
want you to take that

175
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:10,685
same program, do it again in another,
another assignment, or another problem in

176
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:17,430
the chapter, and that is have some kind of
a non-numeric input, and have it blow up.

177
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:23,060
So if they type, you know, something like
nine, put out an error.

178
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,510
Or, if they type something here, put out
an error.

179
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,070
Now, don't write a loop.
No loop.

180
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,240
This is one execution of the program, and
this is another execution of the program.

181
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,160
Later, we can write loops.

182
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,240
We haven't even talked about loops.
So this is running it twice.

183
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,750
All I want you to do is exit.

184
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,290
So take a look in the book as to how to
just get out.

185
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,080
So it, it's, it, I don't want you to try
to say, I'm going to

186
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,900
prompt for these numbers until I get a
good one, we'll do that later.

187
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,910
I just want you to deal with the
fact that

188
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,390
you read a thing, you use the try

189
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,900
to convert it to a float and see if it
works.

190
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,160
And if you don't, you just quit.

191
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,500
Don't, don't, don't try to be tricky and
repeatedly prompt.

192
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,554
So don't repeatedly prompt.
One prompt, and then

193
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:14,870
quit, okay?
So, this is contintous-,

194
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:20,400
conditional execution, if, if then else,
and then I added a little bit with

195
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,810
the try and except, as well.

196
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:26,869
And the try and except is really a
limited kind of a problem.

197
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:32,113
It really is to compensate for errors that
you anticipate are going to happen, and

198
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:34,317
you can imagine what you want to do

199
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:37,650
as a replacement for what those
errors are, okay?

200
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,330
See you next lecture.
