<h1 id="dictionaries">Dictionaries</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>    </p>
<p>A <em>dictionary</em> is like a list, but more general. In a list, the index positions have to be integers; in a dictionary, the indices can be (almost) any type.</p>
<p>You can think of a dictionary as a mapping between a set of indices (which are called <em>keys</em>) and a set of values. Each key maps to a value. The association of a key and a value is called a <em>key-value pair</em> or sometimes an <em>item</em>.</p>
<p>As an example, we’ll build a dictionary that maps from English to Spanish words, so the keys and the values are all strings.</p>
<p>The function <code>dict</code> creates a new dictionary with no items. Because <code>dict</code> is the name of a built-in function, you should avoid using it as a variable name.</p>
<p> </p>
<script type="text/javascript">(function(d,l,s,i,c){function n(e){e=e.nextSibling;return (!e||e.nodeType!=3)?e:n(e);};function r(f){/in/.test(d.readyState) ? setTimeout(function(){r(f);},9):f()};l=d.getElementsByTagName('script');s=l[l.length-1];r(function(){i=n(s),c=n(i);i.setAttribute('data-src','https://trinket.io/tools/1.0/jekyll/embed/python3?runMode=console&outputOnly=true#code='+encodeURIComponent(c.nodeValue.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,'')));});})(document)</script>

<!--
>>> eng2sp = dict()
>>> print(eng2sp)
{}
-->
<p>The curly brackets, <code>{}</code>, represent an empty dictionary. To add items to the dictionary, you can use square brackets:</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> eng2sp[<span class="st">&#39;one&#39;</span>] <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">&#39;uno&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This line creates an item that maps from the key <code>'one'</code> to the value “uno”. If we print the dictionary again, we see a key-value pair with a colon between the key and value:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">print</span>(eng2sp)</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>{<span class="st">&#39;one&#39;</span>: <span class="st">&#39;uno&#39;</span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary with three items. But if you print <code>eng2sp</code>, you might be surprised:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> eng2sp <span class="op">=</span> {<span class="st">&#39;one&#39;</span>: <span class="st">&#39;uno&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;two&#39;</span>: <span class="st">&#39;dos&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;three&#39;</span>: <span class="st">&#39;tres&#39;</span>}</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">print</span>(eng2sp)</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>{<span class="st">&#39;one&#39;</span>: <span class="st">&#39;uno&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;three&#39;</span>: <span class="st">&#39;tres&#39;</span>, <span class="st">&#39;two&#39;</span>: <span class="st">&#39;dos&#39;</span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The order of the key-value pairs is not the same. In fact, if you type the same example on your computer, you might get a different result. In general, the order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable.</p>
<p>But that’s not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with integer indices. Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">print</span>(eng2sp[<span class="st">&#39;two&#39;</span>])</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">&#39;dos&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The key <code>'two'</code> always maps to the value “dos” so the order of the items doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>If the key isn’t in the dictionary, you get an exception:</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">print</span>(eng2sp[<span class="st">&#39;four&#39;</span>])</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="pp">KeyError</span>: <span class="st">&#39;four&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>len</code> function works on dictionaries; it returns the number of key-value pairs:</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">len</span>(eng2sp)</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="dv">3</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>in</code> operator works on dictionaries; it tells you whether something appears as a <em>key</em> in the dictionary (appearing as a value is not good enough).</p>
<p>  </p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;one&#39;</span> <span class="kw">in</span> eng2sp</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">True</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;uno&#39;</span> <span class="kw">in</span> eng2sp</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">False</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>To see whether something appears as a value in a dictionary, you can use the method <code>values</code>, which returns the values as a type that can be converted to a list, and then use the <code>in</code> operator:</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> vals <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">list</span>(eng2sp.values())</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="st">&#39;uno&#39;</span> <span class="kw">in</span> vals</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="va">True</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>in</code> operator uses different algorithms for lists and dictionaries. For lists, it uses a linear search algorithm. As the list gets longer, the search time gets longer in direct proportion to the length of the list. For dictionaries, Python uses an algorithm called a <em>hash table</em> that has a remarkable property: the <code>in</code> operator takes about the same amount of time no matter how many items there are in a dictionary. I won’t explain why hash functions are so magical, but you can read more about it at <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise 1: Download a copy of the file</strong> <a href="http://www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt">www.py4e.com/code3/words.txt</a></p>
<p><strong>Write a program that reads the words in <em>words.txt</em> and stores them as keys in a dictionary. It doesn’t matter what the values are. Then you can use the <code>in</code> operator as a fast way to check whether a string is in the dictionary.</strong></p>
<h2 id="dictionary-as-a-set-of-counters">Dictionary as a set of counters</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Suppose you are given a string and you want to count how many times each letter appears. There are several ways you could do it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You could create 26 variables, one for each letter of the alphabet. Then you could traverse the string and, for each character, increment the corresponding counter, probably using a chained conditional.</p></li>
<li><p>You could create a list with 26 elements. Then you could convert each character to a number (using the built-in function <code>ord</code>), use the number as an index into the list, and increment the appropriate counter.</p></li>
<li><p>You could create a dictionary with characters as keys and counters as the corresponding values. The first time you see a character, you would add an item to the dictionary. After that you would increment the value of an existing item.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these options performs the same computation, but each of them implements that computation in a different way.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An <em>implementation</em> is a way of performing a computation; some implementations are better than others. For example, an advantage of the dictionary implementation is that we don’t have to know ahead of time which letters appear in the string and we only have to make room for the letters that do appear.</p>
<p>Here is what the code might look like:</p>
<script type="text/javascript">(function(d,l,s,i,c){function n(e){e=e.nextSibling;return (!e||e.nodeType!=3)?e:n(e);};function r(f){/in/.test(d.readyState) ? setTimeout(function(){r(f);},9):f()};l=d.getElementsByTagName('script');s=l[l.length-1];r(function(){i=n(s),c=n(i);i.setAttribute('data-src','https://trinket.io/tools/1.0/jekyll/embed/python3?runMode=console&outputOnly=true#code='+encodeURIComponent(c.nodeValue.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,'')));});})(document)</script>

<!--
word = 'brontosaurus'
d = dict()
for c in word:
    if c not in d:
        d[c] = 1
    else:
        d[c] = d[c] + 1
print(d)
-->
<p>We are effectively computing a <em>histogram</em>, which is a statistical term for a set of counters (or frequencies).</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop traverses the string. Each time through the loop, if the character <code>c</code> is not in the dictionary, we create a new item with key <code>c</code> and the initial value 1 (since we have seen this letter once). If <code>c</code> is already in the dictionary we increment <code>d[c]</code>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s the output of the program:</p>
<pre><code>{&#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 1, &#39;o&#39;: 2, &#39;n&#39;: 1, &#39;s&#39;: 2, &#39;r&#39;: 2, &#39;u&#39;: 2, &#39;t&#39;: 1}</code></pre>
<p>The histogram indicates that the letters “a” and “b” appear once; “o” appears twice, and so on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dictionaries have a method called <code>get</code> that takes a key and a default value. If the key appears in the dictionary, <code>get</code> returns the corresponding value; otherwise it returns the default value. For example:</p>
<script type="text/javascript">(function(d,l,s,i,c){function n(e){e=e.nextSibling;return (!e||e.nodeType!=3)?e:n(e);};function r(f){/in/.test(d.readyState) ? setTimeout(function(){r(f);},9):f()};l=d.getElementsByTagName('script');s=l[l.length-1];r(function(){i=n(s),c=n(i);i.setAttribute('data-src','https://trinket.io/tools/1.0/jekyll/embed/python3?runMode=console&outputOnly=true#code='+encodeURIComponent(c.nodeValue.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,'')));});})(document)</script>

<!--
>>> counts = { 'chuck' : 1 , 'annie' : 42, 'jan': 100}
>>> print(counts.get('jan', 0))
100
>>> print(counts.get('tim', 0))
0
-->
<p>We can use <code>get</code> to write our histogram loop more concisely. Because the <code>get</code> method automatically handles the case where a key is not in a dictionary, we can reduce four lines down to one and eliminate the <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<p>The use of the <code>get</code> method to simplify this counting loop ends up being a very commonly used “idiom” in Python and we will use it many times in the rest of the book. So you should take a moment and compare the loop using the <code>if</code> statement and <code>in</code> operator with the loop using the <code>get</code> method. They do exactly the same thing, but one is more succinct.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="dictionaries-and-files">Dictionaries and files</h2>
<p>One of the common uses of a dictionary is to count the occurrence of words in a file with some written text. Let’s start with a very simple file of words taken from the text of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>.</p>
<p>For the first set of examples, we will use a shortened and simplified version of the text with no punctuation. Later we will work with the text of the scene with punctuation included.</p>
<pre><code>But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Who is already sick and pale with grief</code></pre>
<p>We will write a Python program to read through the lines of the file, break each line into a list of words, and then loop through each of the words in the line and count each word using a dictionary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You will see that we have two <code>for</code> loops. The outer loop is reading the lines of the file and the inner loop is iterating through each of the words on that particular line. This is an example of a pattern called <em>nested loops</em> because one of the loops is the <em>outer</em> loop and the other loop is the <em>inner</em> loop.</p>
<p>Because the inner loop executes all of its iterations each time the outer loop makes a single iteration, we think of the inner loop as iterating “more quickly” and the outer loop as iterating more slowly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The combination of the two nested loops ensures that we will count every word on every line of the input file.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">(function(d,l,s,i,c){function n(e){e=e.nextSibling;return (!e||e.nodeType!=3)?e:n(e);};function r(f){/in/.test(d.readyState) ? setTimeout(function(){r(f);},9):f()};l=d.getElementsByTagName('script');s=l[l.length-1];r(function(){i=n(s),c=n(i);i.setAttribute('data-src','https://trinket.io/tools/1.0/jekyll/embed/python3#code='+encodeURIComponent(c.nodeValue.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,'')));});})(document)</script>

Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon

-->
<p>In our <code>else</code> statement, we use the more compact alternative for incrementing a variable. <code>counts[word] += 1</code> is equivalent to <code>counts[word] = counts[word] + 1</code>. Either method can be used to change the value of a variable by any desired amount. Similar alternatives exist for <code>-=</code>, <code>*=</code>, and <code>/=</code>.</p>
<p>When we run the program, we see a raw dump of all of the counts in unsorted hash order. (the <em>romeo.txt</em> file is available at <a href="http://www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt">www.py4e.com/code3/romeo.txt</a>)</p>

<p>It is a bit inconvenient to look through the dictionary to find the most common words and their counts, so we need to add some more Python code to get us the output that will be more helpful.</p>
<h2 id="looping-and-dictionaries">Looping and dictionaries</h2>
<p>  </p>
<p>If you use a dictionary as the sequence in a <code>for</code> statement, it traverses the keys of the dictionary. This loop prints each key and the corresponding value:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>counts <span class="op">=</span> { <span class="st">&#39;chuck&#39;</span> : <span class="dv">1</span> , <span class="st">&#39;annie&#39;</span> : <span class="dv">42</span>, <span class="st">&#39;jan&#39;</span>: <span class="dv">100</span>}</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">for</span> key <span class="kw">in</span> counts:</span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="bu">print</span>(key, counts[key])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s what the output looks like:</p>
<pre><code>jan 100
chuck 1
annie 42</code></pre>
<p>Again, the keys are in no particular order.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We can use this pattern to implement the various loop idioms that we have described earlier. For example if we wanted to find all the entries in a dictionary with a value above ten, we could write the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>counts <span class="op">=</span> { <span class="st">&#39;chuck&#39;</span> : <span class="dv">1</span> , <span class="st">&#39;annie&#39;</span> : <span class="dv">42</span>, <span class="st">&#39;jan&#39;</span>: <span class="dv">100</span>}</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><a href="#cb15-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">for</span> key <span class="kw">in</span> counts:</span>
<span id="cb15-3"><a href="#cb15-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">if</span> counts[key] <span class="op">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">10</span> :</span>
<span id="cb15-4"><a href="#cb15-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="bu">print</span>(key, counts[key])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop iterates through the <em>keys</em> of the dictionary, so we must use the index operator to retrieve the corresponding <em>value</em> for each key. Here’s what the output looks like:</p>
<pre><code>jan 100
annie 42</code></pre>
<p>We see only the entries with a value above 10.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you want to print the keys in alphabetical order, you first make a list of the keys in the dictionary using the <code>keys</code> method available in dictionary objects, and then sort that list and loop through the sorted list, looking up each key and printing out key-value pairs in sorted order as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb17"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb17-1"><a href="#cb17-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>counts <span class="op">=</span> { <span class="st">&#39;chuck&#39;</span> : <span class="dv">1</span> , <span class="st">&#39;annie&#39;</span> : <span class="dv">42</span>, <span class="st">&#39;jan&#39;</span>: <span class="dv">100</span>}</span>
<span id="cb17-2"><a href="#cb17-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>lst <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">list</span>(counts.keys())</span>
<span id="cb17-3"><a href="#cb17-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(lst)</span>
<span id="cb17-4"><a href="#cb17-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>lst.sort()</span>
<span id="cb17-5"><a href="#cb17-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">for</span> key <span class="kw">in</span> lst:</span>
<span id="cb17-6"><a href="#cb17-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="bu">print</span>(key, counts[key])</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here’s what the output looks like:</p>
<pre><code>[&#39;jan&#39;, &#39;chuck&#39;, &#39;annie&#39;]
annie 42
chuck 1
jan 100</code></pre>
<p>First you see the list of keys in unsorted order that we get from the <code>keys</code> method. Then we see the key-value pairs in order from the <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-text-parsing">Advanced text parsing</h2>
<p></p>
<p>In the above example using the file <em>romeo.txt</em>, we made the file as simple as possible by removing all punctuation by hand. The actual text has lots of punctuation, as shown below.</p>
<pre><code>But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,</code></pre>
<p>Since the Python <code>split</code> function looks for spaces and treats words as tokens separated by spaces, we would treat the words “soft!” and “soft” as <em>different</em> words and create a separate dictionary entry for each word.</p>
<p>Also since the file has capitalization, we would treat “who” and “Who” as different words with different counts.</p>
<p>We can solve both these problems by using the string methods <code>lower</code>, <code>punctuation</code>, and <code>translate</code>. The <code>translate</code> is the most subtle of the methods. Here is the documentation for <code>translate</code>:</p>
<p><code>line.translate(str.maketrans(fromstr, tostr, deletestr))</code></p>
<p><em>Replace the characters in <code>fromstr</code> with the character in the same position in <code>tostr</code> and delete all characters that are in <code>deletestr</code>. The <code>fromstr</code> and <code>tostr</code> can be empty strings and the <code>deletestr</code> parameter can be omitted.</em></p>
<p>We will not specify the <code>tostr</code> but we will use the <code>deletestr</code> parameter to delete all of the punctuation. We will even let Python tell us the list of characters that it considers “punctuation”:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="im">import</span> string</span>
<span id="cb20-2"><a href="#cb20-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> string.punctuation</span>
<span id="cb20-3"><a href="#cb20-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">&#39;!&quot;#$%&amp;</span><span class="ch">\&#39;</span><span class="co">()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[</span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="co">]^_`{|}~&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The parameters used by <code>translate</code> were different in Python 2.0.</p>
<p>We make the following modifications to our program:</p>
<script type="text/javascript">(function(d,l,s,i,c){function n(e){e=e.nextSibling;return (!e||e.nodeType!=3)?e:n(e);};function r(f){/in/.test(d.readyState) ? setTimeout(function(){r(f);},9):f()};l=d.getElementsByTagName('script');s=l[l.length-1];r(function(){i=n(s),c=n(i);i.setAttribute('data-src','https://trinket.io/tools/1.0/jekyll/embed/python3#code='+encodeURIComponent(c.nodeValue.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g,'')));});})(document)</script>

Romeo and Juliet
Act 2, Scene 2 

SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.

Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
JULIET appears above at a window

But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!

JULIET

Ay me!

ROMEO

She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.

JULIET

O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

ROMEO

[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

JULIET

'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself.

ROMEO

I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIET

What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO

By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

JULIET

My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO

Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET

How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO

With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

JULIET

If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO

Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.

JULIET

I would not for the world they saw thee here.

ROMEO

I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

JULIET

By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

ROMEO

By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.

JULIET

Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO

Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

JULIET

O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

ROMEO

What shall I swear by?

JULIET

Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.

ROMEO

If my heart's dear love--

JULIET

Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

ROMEO

O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET

What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

ROMEO

The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

JULIET

I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.

ROMEO

Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

JULIET

But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.

Nurse calls within

I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.
Exit, above

ROMEO

O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET

Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

Nurse

[Within] Madam!

JULIET

I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--

Nurse
[Within] Madam!

JULIET

By and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send.

ROMEO

So thrive my soul--

JULIET

A thousand times good night!
Exit, above

ROMEO

A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Retiring

Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET

Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name.

ROMEO

It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!

JULIET

Romeo!

ROMEO

My dear?

JULIET

At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?

ROMEO

At the hour of nine.

JULIET

I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO

Let me stand here till thou remember it.

JULIET

I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.

ROMEO

And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.

JULIET

'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.

ROMEO

I would I were thy bird.

JULIET

Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

Exit above

ROMEO

Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

Exit

<p>Part of learning the “Art of Python” or “Thinking Pythonically” is realizing that Python often has built-in capabilities for many common data analysis problems. Over time, you will see enough example code and read enough of the documentation to know where to look to see if someone has already written something that makes your job much easier.</p>
<p>The following is an abbreviated version of the output:</p>
<pre><code>Enter the file name: romeo-full.txt

<p>Looking through this output is still unwieldy and we can use Python to give us exactly what we are looking for, but to do so, we need to learn about Python <em>tuples</em>. We will pick up this example once we learn about tuples.</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p></p>
<p>As you work with bigger datasets it can become unwieldy to debug by printing and checking data by hand. Here are some suggestions for debugging large datasets:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Scale down the input</dt>
<dd><p>If possible, reduce the size of the dataset. For example if the program reads a text file, start with just the first 10 lines, or with the smallest example you can find. You can either edit the files themselves, or (better) modify the program so it reads only the first <code>n</code> lines.</p>
<p>If there is an error, you can reduce <code>n</code> to the smallest value that manifests the error, and then increase it gradually as you find and correct errors.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Check summaries and types</dt>
<dd><p>Instead of printing and checking the entire dataset, consider printing summaries of the data: for example, the number of items in a dictionary or the total of a list of numbers.</p>
<p>A common cause of runtime errors is a value that is not the right type. For debugging this kind of error, it is often enough to print the type of a value.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Write self-checks</dt>
<dd><p>Sometimes you can write code to check for errors automatically. For example, if you are computing the average of a list of numbers, you could check that the result is not greater than the largest element in the list or less than the smallest. This is called a “sanity check” because it detects results that are “completely illogical”.  </p>
<p>Another kind of check compares the results of two different computations to see if they are consistent. This is called a “consistency check”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Pretty print the output</dt>
<dd>Formatting debugging output can make it easier to spot an error.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Again, time you spend building scaffolding can reduce the time you spend debugging. </p>

<p><strong>Sample Execution:</strong></p>
<pre><code>python dow.py
Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt
{&#39;Fri&#39;: 20, &#39;Thu&#39;: 6, &#39;Sat&#39;: 1}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Exercise 3: Write a program to read through a mail log, build a histogram using a dictionary to count how many messages have come from each email address, and print the dictionary.</strong></p>
<pre><code>Enter file name: mbox-short.txt
{&#39;gopal.ramasammycook@gmail.com&#39;: 1, &#39;louis@media.berkeley.edu&#39;: 3,
&#39;cwen@iupui.edu&#39;: 5, &#39;antranig@caret.cam.ac.uk&#39;: 1,
&#39;rjlowe@iupui.edu&#39;: 2, &#39;gsilver@umich.edu&#39;: 3,
&#39;david.horwitz@uct.ac.za&#39;: 4, &#39;wagnermr@iupui.edu&#39;: 1,
&#39;zqian@umich.edu&#39;: 4, &#39;stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za&#39;: 2,
&#39;ray@media.berkeley.edu&#39;: 1}</code></pre>
<p><strong>Exercise 4: Add code to the above program to figure out who has the most messages in the file. After all the data has been read and the dictionary has been created, look through the dictionary using a maximum loop (see Chapter 5: Maximum and minimum loops) to find who has the most messages and print how many messages the person has.</strong></p>
<pre><code>Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt
cwen@iupui.edu 5

Enter a file name: mbox.txt
zqian@umich.edu 195</code></pre>
<p><strong>Exercise 5: This program records the domain name (instead of the address) where the message was sent from instead of who the mail came from (i.e., the whole email address). At the end of the program, print out the contents of your dictionary.</strong></p>
