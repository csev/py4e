<h3 id="the-strange-history-of-think-python">The strange history of “Think Python”</h3>
<p>(Allen B. Downey)</p>
<p>In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated. The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.</p>
<p>One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect: they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking up the pieces.</p>
<p>Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own book. My goals were:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not read 50 pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize the jargon and define each term at first use.</p></li>
<li><p>Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult topics and split them into a series of small steps.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I needed a title, so on a whim I chose <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>.</p>
<p>My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics, the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students practice.</p>
<p>I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning Python by reading my own book.</p>
<p>Jeff and I revised the book, incorporated a case study by Chris Meyers, and in 2001 we released <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python</em>, also under the GNU Free Documentation License. As Green Tea Press, I published the book and started selling hard copies through Amazon.com and college book stores. Other books from Green Tea Press are available at <a href="greenteapress.com">greenteapress.com</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally had a lot more fun.</p>
<p>Over the last five years I have continued to develop the book, correcting errors, improving some of the examples and adding material, especially exercises. In 2008 I started work on a major revision—at the same time, I was contacted by an editor at Cambridge University Press who was interested in publishing the next edition. Good timing!</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to program and think, at least a little bit, like a computer scientist.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements-for-think-python">Acknowledgements for “Think Python”</h3>
<p>(Allen B. Downey)</p>
<p>First and most importantly, I thank Jeff Elkner, who translated my Java book into Python, which got this project started and introduced me to what has turned out to be my favorite language.</p>
<p>I also thank Chris Meyers, who contributed several sections to <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>.</p>
<p>And I thank the Free Software Foundation for developing the GNU Free Documentation License, which helped make my collaboration with Jeff and Chris possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I also thank the editors at Lulu who worked on <em>How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em>.</p>
<p>I thank all the students who worked with earlier versions of this book and all the contributors (listed in an Appendix) who sent in corrections and suggestions.</p>
<p>And I thank my wife, Lisa, for her work on this book, and Green Tea Press, and everything else, too.</p>
