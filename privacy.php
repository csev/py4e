<p><strong>General Philosphy</strong></p>
<p>
It is often said that if you are not paying for a service, then you are the product. For this service, you are not the product and your data/activity is not the product. We retain only as much of your data as is needed to accomplish your teaching and learning goals and for no other purpose. Wherever possible, we give you control over the retention of your data and respect your wishes with respect to the retention of your data.
</p><p>
Our goal is to comply both with the letter and spirit of privacy laws like the The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulations. Our goal is to have a commitment to learner privacy that exceeds the minimum requirements of these laws.
</p><p>
Much of the software used in this company is open source so you can examine/audit what we are doing with respect to privacy and potentially help us improve our approaches to this very important topic.
