Functions {#funcchap}
=========

Function calls {#functionchap}
--------------

\index{function call}

In the context of programming, a *function* is a named
sequence of statements that performs a computation. When you define a
function, you specify the name and the sequence of statements. Later,
you can "call" the function by name. We have already seen one example of
a *function call*:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> type(32)
<class 'int'>
~~~~

The name of the function is `type`. The expression in
parentheses is called the *argument* of the function. The
argument is a value or variable that we are passing into the function as
input to the function. The result, for the `type` function,
is the type of the argument.

\index{parentheses!argument in}

It is common to say that a function "takes" an argument and "returns" a
result. The result is called the *return value*.

\index{argument}
\index{return value}

Built-in functions
------------------

Python provides a number of important built-in functions that we can use
without needing to provide the function definition. The creators of
Python wrote a set of functions to solve common problems and included
them in Python for us to use.

The `max` and `min` functions give us the largest
and smallest values in a list, respectively:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> max('Hello world')
'w'
>>> min('Hello world')
' '
>>>
~~~~

The `max` function tells us the "largest character" in the
string (which turns out to be the letter "w") and the `min`
function shows us the smallest character (which turns out to be a
space).

Another very common built-in function is the `len` function
which tells us how many items are in its argument. If the argument to
`len` is a string, it returns the number of characters in the
string.

~~~~ {.python}
>>> len('Hello world')
11
>>>
~~~~

These functions are not limited to looking at strings. They can operate
on any set of values, as we will see in later chapters.

You should treat the names of built-in functions as reserved words
(i.e., avoid using "max" as a variable name).

Type conversion functions
-------------------------

\index{conversion!type}
\index{type conversion}

Python also provides built-in functions that convert values from one
type to another. The `int` function takes any value and
converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise:

\index{int function}
\index{function!int}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> int('32')
32
>>> int('Hello')
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Hello'
~~~~

`int` can convert floating-point values to integers, but it
doesn't round off; it chops off the fraction part:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> int(3.99999)
3
>>> int(-2.3)
-2
~~~~

`float` converts integers and strings to floating-point
numbers:

\index{float function}
\index{function!float}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> float(32)
32.0
>>> float('3.14159')
3.14159
~~~~

Finally, `str` converts its argument to a string:

\index{str function}
\index{function!str}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> str(32)
'32'
>>> str(3.14159)
'3.14159'
~~~~

Random numbers
--------------

\index{random number}
\index{number, random}
\index{deterministic}
\index{pseudorandom}

Given the same inputs, most computer programs generate the same outputs
every time, so they are said to be *deterministic*.
Determinism is usually a good thing, since we expect the same
calculation to yield the same result. For some applications, though, we
want the computer to be unpredictable. Games are an obvious example, but
there are more.

Making a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be not so easy, but
there are ways to make it at least seem nondeterministic. One of them is
to use *algorithms* that generate
*pseudorandom* numbers. Pseudorandom numbers are not
truly random because they are generated by a deterministic computation,
but just by looking at the numbers it is all but impossible to
distinguish them from random.

\index{random module}
\index{module!random}

The `random` module provides functions that generate
pseudorandom numbers (which I will simply call "random" from here on).

\index{random function}
\index{function!random}

The function `random` returns a random float between 0.0 and
1.0 (including 0.0 but not 1.0). Each time you call `random`,
you get the next number in a long series. To see a sample, run this
loop:

~~~~ {.python}
import random

for i in range(10):
    x = random.random()
    print(x)
~~~~

This program produces the following list of 10 random numbers between
0.0 and up to but not including 1.0.

~~~~
0.11132867921152356
0.5950949227890241
0.04820265884996877
0.841003109276478
0.997914947094958
0.04842330803368111
0.7416295948208405
0.510535245390327
0.27447040171978143
0.028511805472785867
~~~~

Exercise 1: Run the program on your system and see what numbers you get.
Run the program more than once and see what numbers you get.

The `random` function is only one of many functions that
handle random numbers. The function `randint` takes the
parameters `low` and `high`, and returns an
integer between `low` and `high` (including both).

\index{randint function}
\index{function!randint}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> random.randint(5, 10)
5
>>> random.randint(5, 10)
9
~~~~

To choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use
`choice`:

\index{choice function}
\index{function!choice}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> t = [1, 2, 3]
>>> random.choice(t)
2
>>> random.choice(t)
3
~~~~

The `random` module also provides functions to generate
random values from continuous distributions including Gaussian,
exponential, gamma, and a few more.

Math functions
--------------

\index{math function}
\index{function, math}
\index{module}
\index{module object}

Python has a `math` module that provides most of the familiar
mathematical functions. Before we can use the module, we have to import
it:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> import math
~~~~

This statement creates a *module object* named math. If
you print the module object, you get some information about it:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> print(math)
<module 'math' (built-in)>
~~~~

The module object contains the functions and variables defined in the
module. To access one of the functions, you have to specify the name of
the module and the name of the function, separated by a dot (also known
as a period). This format is called *dot notation*.

\index{dot notation}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> ratio = signal_power / noise_power
>>> decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)

>>> radians = 0.7
>>> height = math.sin(radians)
~~~~

The first example computes the logarithm base 10 of the signal-to-noise
ratio. The math module also provides a function called `log`
that computes logarithms base `e`.

\index{log function}
\index{function!log}
\index{sine function}
\index{radian}
\index{trigonometric function}
\index{function, trigonometric}

The second example finds the sine of `radians`. The name of
the variable is a hint that `sin` and the other trigonometric
functions (`cos`, `tan`, etc.) take arguments in
radians. To convert from degrees to radians, divide by 360 and multiply
by $2
\pi$:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> degrees = 45
>>> radians = degrees / 360.0 * 2 * math.pi
>>> math.sin(radians)
0.7071067811865476
~~~~

The expression `math.pi` gets the variable `pi`
from the math module. The value of this variable is an approximation of
$\pi$, accurate to about 15 digits.

\index{pi}

If you know your trigonometry, you can check the previous result by
comparing it to the square root of two divided by two:

\index{sqrt function}
\index{function!sqrt}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> math.sqrt(2) / 2.0
0.7071067811865476
~~~~

Adding new functions
--------------------

So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but
it is also possible to add new functions. A *function
definition* specifies the name of a new function and the
sequence of statements that execute when the function is called. Once we
define a function, we can reuse the function over and over throughout
our program.

\index{function}
\index{function definition}
\index{definition!function}

Here is an example:

~~~~ {.python}
def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print('I sleep all night and I work all day.')
~~~~

`def` is a keyword that indicates that this is a function
definition. The name of the function is `print_lyrics`. The rules for
function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and
some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character can't be a
number. You can't use a keyword as the name of a function, and you
should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.

\index{def keyword}
\index{keyword!def}
\index{argument}

The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn't
take any arguments. Later we will build functions that take arguments as
their inputs.

\index{parentheses!empty}
\index{header}
\index{body}
\index{indentation}
\index{colon}

The first line of the function definition is called the
*header*; the rest is called the *body*.
The header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By
convention, the indentation is always four spaces. The body can contain
any number of statements.

The strings in the print statements are enclosed in quotes. Single
quotes and double quotes do the same thing; most people use single
quotes except in cases like this where a single quote (which is also an
apostrophe) appears in the string.

\index{ellipses}

If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter
prints ellipses (*...*) to let you know that the definition isn't
complete:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> def print_lyrics():
...     print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
...     print('I sleep all night and I work all day.')
...
~~~~

To end the function, you have to enter an empty line (this is not
necessary in a script).

Defining a function creates a variable with the same name.

~~~~ {.python}
>>> print(print_lyrics)
<function print_lyrics at 0xb7e99e9c>
>>> print(type(print_lyrics))
<class 'function'>
~~~~

The value of `print_lyrics` is a *function object*, which
has type "function".

\index{function object}
\index{object!function}

The syntax for calling the new function is the same as for built-in
functions:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> print_lyrics()
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
~~~~

Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another
function. For example, to repeat the previous refrain, we could write a
function called `repeat_lyrics`:

~~~~ {.python}
def repeat_lyrics():
    print_lyrics()
    print_lyrics()
~~~~

And then call `repeat_lyrics`:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> repeat_lyrics()
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.
I sleep all night and I work all day.
~~~~

But that's not really how the song goes.

Definitions and uses
--------------------

\index{function definition}

Pulling together the code fragments from the previous section, the whole
program looks like this:

\VerbatimInput{../code3/lyrics.py}

This program contains two function definitions: `print_lyrics` and
`repeat_lyrics`. Function definitions get executed just like other
statements, but the effect is to create function objects. The statements
inside the function do not get executed until the function is called,
and the function definition generates no output.

\index{use before def}

As you might expect, you have to create a function before you can
execute it. In other words, the function definition has to be executed
before the first time it is called.

Exercise 2: Move the last line of this program to the top, so the
function call appears before the definitions. Run the program and see
what error message you get.

Exercise 3: Move the function call back to the bottom and move the
definition of `print_lyrics` after the definition of `repeat_lyrics`.
What happens when you run this program?

Flow of execution
-----------------

\index{flow of execution}

In order to ensure that a function is defined before its first use, you
have to know the order in which statements are executed, which is called
the *flow of execution*.

Execution always begins at the first statement of the program.
Statements are executed one at a time, in order from top to bottom.

Function *definitions* do not alter the flow of execution of the
program, but remember that statements inside the function are not
executed until the function is called.

A function call is like a detour in the flow of execution. Instead of
going to the next statement, the flow jumps to the body of the function,
executes all the statements there, and then comes back to pick up where
it left off.

That sounds simple enough, until you remember that one function can call
another. While in the middle of one function, the program might have to
execute the statements in another function. But while executing that new
function, the program might have to execute yet another function!

Fortunately, Python is good at keeping track of where it is, so each
time a function completes, the program picks up where it left off in the
function that called it. When it gets to the end of the program, it
terminates.

What's the moral of this sordid tale? When you read a program, you don't
always want to read from top to bottom. Sometimes it makes more sense if
you follow the flow of execution.

Parameters and arguments {#parameters}
------------------------

\index{parameter}
\index{function parameter}
\index{argument}
\index{function argument}

Some of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments. For
example, when you call `math.sin` you pass a number as an
argument. Some functions take more than one argument:
`math.pow` takes two, the base and the exponent.

Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called
*parameters*. Here is an example of a user-defined
function that takes an argument:

\index{parentheses!parameters in}

~~~~ {.python}
def print_twice(bruce):
    print(bruce)
    print(bruce)
~~~~

This function assigns the argument to a parameter named
`bruce`. When the function is called, it prints the value of
the parameter (whatever it is) twice.

This function works with any value that can be printed.

~~~~ {.python}
>>> print_twice('Spam')
Spam
Spam
>>> print_twice(17)
17
17
>>> import math
>>> print_twice(math.pi)
3.141592653589793
3.141592653589793
~~~~

The same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also
apply to user-defined functions, so we can use any kind of expression as
an argument for `print_twice`:

\index{composition}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> print_twice('Spam '*4)
Spam Spam Spam Spam
Spam Spam Spam Spam
>>> print_twice(math.cos(math.pi))
-1.0
-1.0
~~~~

The argument is evaluated before the function is called, so in the
examples the expressions "Spam '*4` and `math.cos(math.pi)`
are only evaluated once.

\index{argument}

You can also use a variable as an argument:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> michael = 'Eric, the half a bee.'
>>> print_twice(michael)
Eric, the half a bee.
Eric, the half a bee.
~~~~

The name of the variable we pass as an argument (`michael`)
has nothing to do with the name of the parameter (`bruce`).
It doesn't matter what the value was called back home (in the caller);
here in `print_twice`, we call everybody `bruce`.

Fruitful functions and void functions
-------------------------------------

\index{fruitful function}
\index{void function}
\index{function, fruitful}
\index{function, void}

Some of the functions we are using, such as the math functions, yield
results; for lack of a better name, I call them *fruitful
functions*. Other functions, like `print_twice`, perform an
action but don't return a value. They are called *void
functions*.

When you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do
something with the result; for example, you might assign it to a
variable or use it as part of an expression:

~~~~ {.python}
x = math.cos(radians)
golden = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
~~~~

When you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the
result:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> math.sqrt(5)
2.23606797749979
~~~~

But in a script, if you call a fruitful function and do not store the
result of the function in a variable, the return value vanishes into the
mist!

~~~~ {.python}
math.sqrt(5)
~~~~

This script computes the square root of 5, but since it doesn't store
the result in a variable or display the result, it is not very useful.

\index{interactive mode}
\index{script mode}

Void functions might display something on the screen or have some other
effect, but they don't have a return value. If you try to assign the
result to a variable, you get a special value called `None`.

\index{None special value}
\index{special value!None}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> result = print_twice('Bing')
Bing
Bing
>>> print(result)
None
~~~~

The value `None` is not the same as the string "None". It
is a special value that has its own type:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> print(type(None))
<class 'NoneType'>
~~~~

To return a result from a function, we use the `return`
statement in our function. For example, we could make a very simple
function called `addtwo` that adds two numbers together and
returns a result.

\VerbatimInput{../code3/addtwo.py}

When this script executes, the `print` statement will print
out "8" because the `addtwo` function was called with 3 and 5
as arguments. Within the function, the parameters `a` and
`b` were 3 and 5 respectively. The function computed the sum
of the two numbers and placed it in the local function variable named
`added`. Then it used the `return` statement to
send the computed value back to the calling code as the function result,
which was assigned to the variable `x` and printed out.

Why functions?
--------------

\index{function, reasons for}

It may not be clear why it is worth the trouble to divide a program into
functions. There are several reasons:

-   Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of
    statements, which makes your program easier to read, understand, and
    debug.

-   Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.
    Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.

-   Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts
    one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.

-   Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you
    write and debug one, you can reuse it.

Throughout the rest of the book, often we will use a function definition
to explain a concept. Part of the skill of creating and using functions
is to have a function properly capture an idea such as "find the
smallest value in a list of values". Later we will show you code that
finds the smallest in a list of values and we will present it to you as
a function named `min` which takes a list of values as its
argument and returns the smallest value in the list.

Debugging {#editor}
---------

\index{debugging}

If you are using a text editor to write your scripts, you might run into
problems with spaces and tabs. The best way to avoid these problems is
to use spaces exclusively (no tabs). Most text editors that know about
Python do this by default, but some don't.

\index{whitespace}

Tabs and spaces are usually invisible, which makes them hard to debug,
so try to find an editor that manages indentation for you.

Also, don't forget to save your program before you run it. Some
development environments do this automatically, but some don't. In that
case, the program you are looking at in the text editor is not the same
as the program you are running.

Debugging can take a long time if you keep running the same incorrect
program over and over!

Make sure that the code you are looking at is the code you are running.
If you're not sure, put something like `print("hello")` at the beginning
of the program and run it again. If you don't see `hello`, you're not
running the right program!
