1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:02,078
- So, now we have a socket.

2
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:03,228
We are going to talk

3
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:04,609
about what we're going
to do with it, right.

4
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:06,889
So, the socket basically
functions at this level:

5
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:09,279
your application is
saying, "Make me a socket,"

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,830
which is sort of this end point,

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,292
and then the connect actually
connects to an application

8
00:00:13,292 --> 00:00:15,591
on the far side and
there's a port involved,

9
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:17,190
so that might be port 80.

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,796
And, this is the far host

11
00:00:18,796 --> 00:00:25,139
and that could be
www.py4e.org or data.py4e.org,

12
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:28,216
okay, and so the socket is solving this

13
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:31,732
and the question, then, is

14
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:32,893
what are we gonna send

15
00:00:32,893 --> 00:00:34,542
and what are we gonna expect to get back?

16
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:36,713
And, that's what we call
the application protocol.

17
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:39,122
So, we know that these
two have made a phone call

18
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,973
and it's no different
than making the phone call

19
00:00:40,973 --> 00:00:43,985
and saying, you know, "Hello," right?

20
00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:46,778
And, everyone knows that
when the phone rings

21
00:00:46,778 --> 00:00:49,177
and you pick it up, you're
supposed to say, "Hello,"

22
00:00:49,177 --> 00:00:50,606
and that's part of our protocols.

23
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:52,429
So, who talks first, right?

24
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,838
So, the dominant protocol
that we use on this,

25
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:57,679
in this section, is the HTTP protocol.

26
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,984
That's, the key is a
Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

27
00:01:00,984 --> 00:01:01,817
It's dominant.

28
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:02,687
It's really easy to use,

29
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,036
that's why I used it as an example,

30
00:01:04,036 --> 00:01:05,765
but realize that there are many others

31
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,955
like mail and file
transfer and remote login

32
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:10,753
and all kinds of other protocols;

33
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:12,733
each is a different application protocol.

34
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:15,330
They all use, sort of,
sockets at their lower level,

35
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,463
but then on top of that, they
layer the rules of the road

36
00:01:18,463 --> 00:01:22,123
for retrieving HyperText web pages

37
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:26,093
and we have used these for
all kinds of other things.

38
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:27,341
So, the protocol, like I said,

39
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:28,883
it's like who answers the phone first.

40
00:01:28,883 --> 00:01:30,043
What do they say,

41
00:01:30,043 --> 00:01:31,991
what happens if the person
doesn't answer right,

42
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,516
can you hear me now?

43
00:01:33,516 --> 00:01:35,828
Those kind of things, and
it's a real simple thing,

44
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,767
and all you really need to do is,

45
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,657
so that both sides can agree,
you have to just write a thing

46
00:01:40,657 --> 00:01:42,469
that's like the rules in the middle

47
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,319
and say, "Okay, everybody,

48
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:46,759
"as long as we all do
this, we'll be fine."

49
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,500
It's as simple as picking
on which side of the road

50
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,820
the cars can drive on.

51
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,986
It works fine no matter which side,

52
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:55,237
but if each car randomly picked,

53
00:01:55,237 --> 00:01:58,194
it would be, really, kind of a mess.

54
00:01:58,194 --> 00:01:59,924
So, if you look at the typical URL

55
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:01,095
and this is one of the things

56
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:05,044
that the Web innovators
in 1980 really invented

57
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:08,225
that was wonderful and it
seems second nature, today,

58
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:10,405
but in 1990, it was rather revolutionary

59
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:13,116
in that these Uniform Resource Locators

60
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:16,317
encrypted and included
in themselves a protocol,

61
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:18,886
the host to connect to and
the document to retrieve.

62
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:22,543
So, this is one of the
clever, clever ideas

63
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,888
that the Web came up with
because we used to have to pick

64
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:31,485
a program, like FTP or
Telnet or whatever, SMTP,

65
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,408
and then we had to go to the right host

66
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:36,646
and then we had to talk to
that host a certain way.

67
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:39,569
So, in HTTP, it's a really simple protocol

68
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,359
invented in 1989 and 1990

69
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:48,848
by Tim Berners-Lee and
Robert Cailliau at CERN

70
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:50,928
and they created a protocol

71
00:02:50,928 --> 00:02:53,429
that we have grown to know and love

72
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:55,807
and used for way more
than retrieving documents,

73
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:58,468
as we'll see in the upcoming chapters.

74
00:02:58,468 --> 00:03:00,128
So, we're gonna talk a
little bit about what happens

75
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:02,425
when you click on a page that has a link.

76
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:04,467
Now, there's all kind of
fancy stuff that can go on,

77
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:06,267
but this is the basics.

78
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:08,186
And, so, lets just imagine for the moment

79
00:03:08,186 --> 00:03:10,406
you just are sitting looking at a webpage,

80
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:14,568
Dr-Chuck.com/page1 and inside
that there is a hyperlink.

81
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:16,547
It is a indication that says,

82
00:03:16,547 --> 00:03:20,268
"When you click on this page,
go to a different page,"

83
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:23,598
and, in that, you see the name of the page

84
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,326
that you're supposed to go to.

85
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:30,607
So, we click on this link
and that is a browser.

86
00:03:30,607 --> 00:03:35,585
This is an application, this is a process,

87
00:03:35,585 --> 00:03:37,034
or an app
(computer keys clicking)

88
00:03:37,034 --> 00:03:38,299
that's running on your computer;

89
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:39,788
this is the browser, okay?

90
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:42,948
And, when the browser sees the
click inside your computer,

91
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:46,457
then the browser make
a connection to port 80

92
00:03:46,457 --> 00:03:51,659
on the web server, Dr-Chuck.com
and sends the request.

93
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:55,647
This request that it sends
is precisely specified

94
00:03:55,647 --> 00:03:58,088
by a standard, which we
will see in a second.

95
00:03:58,088 --> 00:04:01,707
Then, the web server some magic work,

96
00:04:01,707 --> 00:04:03,399
oops, let's go back,

97
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:05,698
then, the web server does
some magic work in here,

98
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:08,098
reads some files, runs
some code, does whatever,

99
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:12,719
constructs an answer to our
phone call and sends it back

100
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,368
and it sends, in this case, back a webpage

101
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:19,245
in the format of HTML, the
Hypertext Markup Language,

102
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:21,067
which is different than HTTP,

103
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,965
which is the protocol
that we're exchanging.

104
00:04:22,965 --> 00:04:25,483
HTML is the format of the
document we're getting back

105
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:27,562
and, in this, has an anchor tag,

106
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:30,703
href in then end of anchor
tag and some highlighted text,

107
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:33,251
and now your browser gets this back

108
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,903
and then renders it according
to the rules of HTML and CSS

109
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:39,222
and Javascript, et cetera, parses it

110
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:40,754
and then makes a pretty webpage

111
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:41,944
and this web page happens to have

112
00:04:41,944 --> 00:04:44,464
a link back to the first
page and if you click there,

113
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:46,873
it will do this over
and over and over again.

114
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:49,502
And, that is the request-response cycle

115
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:52,831
and that's governed by a
series of Internet standards.

116
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:54,463
These are standards that were built

117
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:57,050
and from the '60s, '70s, '80s and '90s

118
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,311
and continue to this day, by a group

119
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:02,971
called the Internet
Engineering Task Force or IETF.

120
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:06,057
The documents they produce are called RFCs

121
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:09,870
which stands for Request For Comments.

122
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,236
The RFC, the word RFC is kind of like,

123
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:14,549
a sort of joke, as it were.

124
00:05:14,549 --> 00:05:18,830
It's, they're trying to kind of funny

125
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,309
in that, ah, funny is not the right word,

126
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:23,727
they're, it's ironic in
that they're trying say,

127
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,481
even some of the protocols of the Internet

128
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:28,199
that we've used for several decades,

129
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,122
they're always interested in improvements

130
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,510
and that's what the RFC stands for

131
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,792
and they're all named RFC dash whatever.

132
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,211
And, if we were gonna cruise around,

133
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,365
we could find some various RFCs

134
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:40,518
and this is RFC 2616.

135
00:05:40,518 --> 00:05:42,943
It might have been revised since then,

136
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:45,804
but this is like a document and
this is what they look like,

137
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:48,453
Hypertext Transfer Protocol, version one.

138
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:49,493
And so, you're reading this document,

139
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:50,985
you're gonna write a
browser and you want to talk

140
00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:53,734
to the application protocol that is HTTP,

141
00:05:53,734 --> 00:05:55,333
this is one of many documents

142
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,494
that helps define what HTTP is.

143
00:05:58,494 --> 00:06:00,366
So, if you look and you
looked down and said,

144
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:01,821
"Oh, here's what a request looks like.

145
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,303
"This is how I'm gonna get
a document from the server,"

146
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:08,392
and you keep reading and
you keep reading and it says

147
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:11,518
you're supposed to have the
request method with a space,

148
00:06:11,518 --> 00:06:14,659
with a request URL, the
request method with a space,

149
00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:16,928
with a URI with a space, the HTTP version

150
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:18,436
and the carriage return and a line feed,

151
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:19,790
that's what it's saying.

152
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,210
And so, it looks kind of like this, right?

153
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,327
We say get the document,
followed by a space.

154
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:27,741
They've got to be one
space; you do two spaces

155
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,749
and it's going to be
quite frustrating, okay.

156
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:34,479
And so, this is an
example that you can run

157
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,979
on a number of,

158
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:40,848
on Linux operating systems

159
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:43,736
and Macintosh operating
systems with no changes.

160
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,208
If you installed Telnet
on your Windows box,

161
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,716
you should be able to run
something like this, as well.

162
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:53,426
So, Telnet is a program that
we used in the old days.

163
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,025
It used to be how we logged into servers,

164
00:06:55,025 --> 00:06:57,099
but because it doesn't encrypt
your data back and forth,

165
00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:58,617
we don't use it anymore.

166
00:06:58,617 --> 00:07:00,509
But, it basically is a program

167
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:04,977
that can open a socket to a host on a port

168
00:07:04,977 --> 00:07:07,854
and I'm saying Telnet
to this host on port 80

169
00:07:07,854 --> 00:07:09,417
and at this point, I am connected

170
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:11,535
and whatever I type on my
keyboard is gonna be sent

171
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:12,704
to that server.

172
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:13,853
Now, if you're doing
this, you probably want

173
00:07:13,853 --> 00:07:16,061
to cut and paste this really fast

174
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,895
because if you take too long,

175
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,981
most web servers will be, like,

176
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,881
"You're a human, I don't
want to talk to humans;

177
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:22,080
"I want to talk to programs."

178
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,442
So, remember to type this fast enough

179
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:27,200
and then you have to hit Enter, twice,

180
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,950
so you have to have a blank line, here.

181
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,181
Just type this exactly as it's shown

182
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:34,531
and then you will get back,
a server, if you do it right,

183
00:07:34,531 --> 00:07:37,102
the server, and the server's
properly configured,

184
00:07:37,102 --> 00:07:40,891
the server will give you back some headers

185
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:42,922
and this is metadata about the
document you're going to get.

186
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:45,842
For example, it's saying
it's got text/html

187
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,633
which means that the
remaining stuff is gonna be

188
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,653
in HTML, Hypertext Markup Language.

189
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:52,501
It has a blank line and
then the actual document

190
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,413
and then the connection is closed.

191
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:57,442
And so, if you do this, you
can set this up in a way

192
00:07:57,442 --> 00:08:00,102
that you can run this on your own computer

193
00:08:00,102 --> 00:08:04,332
and, in effect, hack through
the back door, a web server.

194
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:08,354
Now, you can't hack the secure
web servers and mail servers.

195
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:09,892
They used to be easy to hack,

196
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:10,979
but they're harder to hack, now,

197
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,249
because they challenge
you for information,

198
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:17,171
but part of the reason I'm so
obsessed with the command line

199
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:18,811
is this is how real hackers work

200
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:19,972
and they know how

201
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:22,373
to talk some of these
protocols, more directly.

202
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:24,089
And so, we think of this beautiful,

203
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:27,481
sophisticated application
talking to some other thing

204
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:29,501
and it's all pretty and we
got wonderful clicky buttons

205
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:32,340
and nice usability, but the reality is,

206
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,268
like in The Matrix Reloaded,
here, the kinds of things

207
00:08:36,268 --> 00:08:39,657
that really talented hackers
are doing use command lines

208
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:41,539
and they really know what's going on

209
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,371
and that's how they do it.

210
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:45,359
They understand what's going
on better than the developers

211
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,466
of the computers that are trying
to be resistant to hacking.

212
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:51,499
So, I come from a long line
of using the command line

213
00:08:51,499 --> 00:08:54,039
and that's why I encourage
you to use the command line

214
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,251
in this course.

215
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:57,477
So, the next thing we're going to do is

216
00:08:57,477 --> 00:08:59,789
we're going to go up into
the application layer

217
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,029
and instead of typing
those commands by hand,

218
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,957
we're going to actually
send them from Python

219
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:09,709
and write a very simple
Python web browser.
