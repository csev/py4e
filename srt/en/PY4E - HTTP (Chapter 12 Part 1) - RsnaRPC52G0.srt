00:00:00,767 --> 00:00:02,496
- Welcome to Networked Programs.

2
00:00:02,496 --> 00:00:03,598
This is Chapter 12.

3
00:00:03,598 --> 00:00:05,496
Now we're going to learn a little bit

4
00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:09,172
about how we talk to
resources on the network

5
00:00:09,172 --> 00:00:10,761
using Python.

6
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,960
Now, this is a really quick introduction

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,304
into how the network really works.

8
00:00:15,304 --> 00:00:17,756
I have a whole book that I wrote.

9
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:19,809
It's also translated into Spanish,

10
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:21,156
on how the network works.

11
00:00:21,156 --> 00:00:23,367
Starting at the very lowest layer,

12
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:24,756
packets and everything,

13
00:00:24,756 --> 00:00:25,589
right on up,

14
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:26,939
and it's actually really easy to read.

15
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:29,481
I wrote it for a high school audience.

16
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:32,972
It's a short book and pretty easy to read.

17
00:00:32,972 --> 00:00:33,910
So if you read that book

18
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,710
you will understand that there is this

19
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,876
layered architecture,

20
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:40,667
the TCP architecture that
sort of runs our network.

21
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,637
At the lowest layer,

22
00:00:41,637 --> 00:00:43,953
on one side here this is your computer

23
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:45,996
and this is server computer

24
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:47,720
and if you start on a web page,

25
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,128
goes across the network,

26
00:00:49,128 --> 00:00:51,384
does this like 15 or 20 times,

27
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,078
that goes up into the server,

28
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:54,714
reads the data

29
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:59,127
and then the data comes back
15, 20 tops for the packets,

30
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:04,131
and then it's shown to
you as what you see.

31
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,324
And so that's how it works

32
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:07,672
and there's these layers

33
00:01:07,672 --> 00:01:09,462
that we're not going to
talk about in this section

34
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:12,177
but I talk about in that book.

35
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:13,512
The layers of the link layer

36
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:15,194
which talk about how to get over one hop,

37
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:16,381
the internet layer

38
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:18,253
which talks about how to construct,

39
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:21,284
say 15 or so hops

40
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:23,894
to get packets back and forth.

41
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:26,413
That's the sort of lower level bits.

42
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:27,466
We're gonna start at what we call

43
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:28,539
the transport layer

44
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:31,003
and that's the layer where your computer

45
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:33,998
sort of assumes that it
can make a phone call

46
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:34,864
to another computer.

47
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:35,697
Another process

48
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:37,845
running on a program on this computer

49
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:39,563
talks to a program on this computer

50
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:41,401
and then it kind of comes back.

51
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:44,516
Okay and so we're gonna leave this alone,

52
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:45,784
we're going to ignore it.

53
00:01:45,784 --> 00:01:47,016
We're going to assume that there's this

54
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:48,599
nice reliable pipe that's going from

55
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,283
point A to point B

56
00:01:50,283 --> 00:01:51,827
and what are we gonna do with the pipe?

57
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:53,087
But if you're interested,

58
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:54,582
take a look at the book.

59
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,815
So we're just gonna start with the pipe.

60
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:58,057
Some kind of connection.

61
00:01:58,057 --> 00:02:00,495
We have two processes,

62
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,286
process, process

63
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:04,291
and we have some kind of a connection

64
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,371
between them

65
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:07,147
and it is a connection
that we can both use

66
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:11,217
to talk and to listen.

67
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:13,796
In nerd terms we call these things sockets

68
00:02:13,796 --> 00:02:16,350
and that is one process
running on one computer

69
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,616
another process running
on a second computer,

70
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:21,818
connected through the internet somehow

71
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:24,648
and one computer speaks into that socket

72
00:02:24,648 --> 00:02:25,797
and it comes out

73
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:28,642
and the other computer returns
something and it comes.

74
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:31,087
And so this is a bi-directional protocol

75
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:34,063
of data which is a series of an effect

76
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:36,660
data phone calls between applications.

77
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,032
So the application might be on your side,

78
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:41,911
this might be your browser.

79
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,063
Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer.

80
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:47,952
On the other side this is a web server.

81
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:49,642
It might be Internet IIS,

82
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:51,747
Internet something
something from Microsoft

83
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:54,824
or Apache or Java Tomcat.

84
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:56,206
There's another program

85
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:57,724
and you are making phone calls

86
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,137
between these programs.

87
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,017
Now in general these servers here

88
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:03,543
stay up all the time

89
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:04,733
and you sort of just can

90
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,126
make a request when you feel like it

91
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:07,766
in your program.

92
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:08,947
But that's what we're going to do

93
00:03:08,947 --> 00:03:11,335
and this is what we call a socket.

94
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:12,598
So that little connection,

95
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:13,486
that phone call,

96
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:17,240
that data phone call is
what we call a socket.

97
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,055
Now, you have to decide

98
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:21,686
which of the systems you're gonna talk to

99
00:03:21,686 --> 00:03:23,118
and then which of the services

100
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:25,521
on those systems or which process.

101
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:28,216
And so we have this
concept called port numbers

102
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,225
and they're best thought of

103
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:30,791
like extensions on phones.

104
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:33,122
So one organization has one phone number

105
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:34,759
and it says, "please enter the extension

106
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,643
of the party you'd like to talk to".

107
00:03:36,643 --> 00:03:38,375
Well that's kind of what ports are.

108
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,585
They're like, "I'm a server

109
00:03:40,585 --> 00:03:41,661
and I'm connected to the internet,

110
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:44,119
please enter the extension of the process

111
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,901
that you would like to talk to."

112
00:03:45,901 --> 00:03:47,357
And so for example,

113
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:48,483
there might be processes

114
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:51,154
running on various computers

115
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:53,043
and so the email's known to hang out

116
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:54,522
on cross port 25

117
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:55,976
or extension 25.

118
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:57,408
Login, insecure login,

119
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:59,323
lives on port 23,

120
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:01,195
and secure web lives on 80

121
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:02,924
and secure web lives on 443

122
00:04:02,924 --> 00:04:04,807
and there's a couple
of different protocols,

123
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:07,235
say if you have your mail stored on Gmail

124
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:09,449
and you have a local mail client,

125
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,459
say like Thunderbird or Apple mail

126
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,008
that talks a protocol

127
00:04:13,008 --> 00:04:14,262
to pull that mail across

128
00:04:14,262 --> 00:04:16,036
and those live on various ports.

129
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:18,908
So, these ports are those extensions

130
00:04:18,908 --> 00:04:21,514
and by convention

131
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:23,525
we have standards that tell us

132
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:26,436
what to roughly expect at those ports.

133
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:28,541
So when you're talking to port 80,

134
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,661
you expect to talk to a web server

135
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:33,411
or a http server.

136
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:34,905
If you're talking on port 23,

137
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:36,713
you expect to talk to a Telnet server

138
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:38,155
and on and on and on and on

139
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:39,682
and so these are the extensions,

140
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:43,438
the typical, commonly
used default extensions

141
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:46,619
for various network application processes

142
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,807
that are serving us data.

143
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,502
Now sometimes you'll go to a URL

144
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:52,504
and you'll see in that URL

145
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:53,416
there's a colon and a number,

146
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,581
that means that it's a web server

147
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:57,212
that's running on a port other than

148
00:04:57,212 --> 00:05:01,090
the official 80 or 443 port.

149
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,670
Now, in Python we can
talk to these sockets,

150
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,235
right, we can just talk to them

151
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:07,603
and it's really easy,

152
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:10,303
surprisingly easy.

153
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:11,518
We have to import socket

154
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:12,718
'cause that's a library,

155
00:05:12,718 --> 00:05:15,317
it comes with Python

156
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:18,212
but you can't use it in your program

157
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:20,121
until you say it.

158
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:22,175
And then you, basically
in the socket library

159
00:05:22,175 --> 00:05:23,547
you call socket function,

160
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:26,771
that's what that syntax is saying.

161
00:05:26,771 --> 00:05:27,787
You're making a socket.

162
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:28,695
Now the key to a socket

163
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:32,245
is sort of like an unopened file handle,

164
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:33,506
it's half of a file handle

165
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,223
it's an outward looking thing

166
00:05:35,223 --> 00:05:36,677
that's not yet connected.

167
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:37,549
These parameters,

168
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:39,080
you're just gonna type them in.

169
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,367
This says we're gonna make a socket

170
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:41,780
that goes across the internet

171
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,861
and it's a stream socket

172
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:44,941
which means that it's
a series of characters

173
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,612
that come one after another

174
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:48,383
rather than a series of blocks of text.

175
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:49,491
There's another kind

176
00:05:49,491 --> 00:05:50,659
that's harder to deal with

177
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,712
but we're gonna do this.

178
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:54,124
So this, don't worry about this line,

179
00:05:54,124 --> 00:05:55,672
just know that this creates a socket

180
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:57,831
but does not associate it.

181
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,969
The very next line,

182
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:01,279
we get back a socket object

183
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,951
that I'm storing in the variable mysock.

184
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,715
And then when you wanna make a connection

185
00:06:05,715 --> 00:06:07,053
across the internet,

186
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,324
to the far end,

187
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,354
you say, "oh, hey, dear socket,

188
00:06:10,354 --> 00:06:11,819
extend yourself across the internet,

189
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:14,563
make the phone call to this host,

190
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:17,053
data.pr4e.org

191
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:18,468
and on that port 80."

192
00:06:18,468 --> 00:06:20,130
So that's making the phone call.

193
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,455
This is like a phone number

194
00:06:21,455 --> 00:06:23,101
and this is like the phone extension.

195
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:25,345
So we haven't sent any data yet,

196
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:27,293
we have simply run the phone

197
00:06:27,293 --> 00:06:28,952
of a process,

198
00:06:28,952 --> 00:06:30,837
hopefully living on port 80.

199
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:31,920
If it's there, great.

200
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,954
This might blow up.

201
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:34,019
This one here won't blow up.

202
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:34,986
But this line here

203
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:36,214
we could blow up

204
00:06:36,214 --> 00:06:37,515
if there's nothing
sitting on that process.

205
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:38,488
It would come back and say,

206
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:39,769
"Oh, you tried to call?

207
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:40,736
You got no answer."

208
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:42,368
That's a legitimate thing to happen.

209
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:44,283
Maybe you don't have a network connection

210
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:46,728
or maybe that service
is down on that server

211
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:48,314
or the whole server's down.

212
00:06:48,314 --> 00:06:50,672
But...

213
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:53,557
So I just, it's kind of amazing

214
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:55,590
that we're sitting here in Python

215
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,400
and in three lines we have

216
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,710
probably half a million engineers

217
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,233
have built this thing called the internet,

218
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,420
all these protocols and all this software.

219
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,039
And we just made use of it

220
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,272
in three lines of Python.

221
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:10,063
And I guess this is one of the reasons

222
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,689
that people absolutely love Python.

223
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:15,146
Absolutely love Python.

224
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:16,829
So, now that we have a socket

225
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:18,313
we have to ask ourselves

226
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,617
what kind of data are we going to send

227
00:07:20,617 --> 00:07:21,598
and then what kind of data

228
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:23,471
are we going to expect to receive

229
00:07:23,471 --> 00:07:25,054
across that socket.
