1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,029
- So now what we wanna
do is use some of these

2
00:00:02,029 --> 00:00:04,913
newfound skills in some
more practical applications

3
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:06,969
of regular expressions.

4
00:00:06,969 --> 00:00:10,656
So let's go back to the way
we first tore apart strings

5
00:00:10,656 --> 00:00:14,101
and look at the situation
where if you recall

6
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:16,082
we just wanted the host name, right?

7
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:17,877
This is an email address
and we're interested

8
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:18,876
in the host name.

9
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:22,358
So we have this string, and
we go find the at, right?

10
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:26,160
The find looks up and tells
us the at is at position 21.

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,875
And then what we do is say
okay, let's look beyond there

12
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,312
to the space and that tells us the space

13
00:00:31,312 --> 00:00:33,820
is in position 31.

14
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,847
And then we're saying
we can extract starting

15
00:00:36,847 --> 00:00:39,789
beyond the at sign, up to
but not including the space

16
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:43,419
by saying atpos plus one
colon space position.

17
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,442
And when we get that,

18
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:47,468
now we have to have a thing that decides

19
00:00:47,468 --> 00:00:49,050
to only look at this on from lines,

20
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,609
but then it can print out the host

21
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,099
that is extracting of this information.

22
00:00:53,099 --> 00:00:55,802
So that was one way
that we did that, right?

23
00:00:55,802 --> 00:00:57,538
One way we did it.

24
00:00:57,538 --> 00:00:59,155
The next way we did this was

25
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:01,535
the double split pattern, right?

26
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:03,877
So we said, okay let's take this line,

27
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:07,446
let's break it into
words, based on spaces.

28
00:01:07,446 --> 00:01:08,485
That's what words is.

29
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,920
So that's zero, one, two,
three, four, five, six.

30
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,084
And then we know that the
email address on lines

31
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:18,008
that start with from
space is the second one

32
00:01:18,008 --> 00:01:19,472
so we pull out email address

33
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:23,006
which pulls this bit out into email.

34
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:25,428
And then we're gonna split that again

35
00:01:25,428 --> 00:01:28,219
based on the at sign.

36
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:30,475
So we're gonna split this part
again based on that at sign

37
00:01:30,475 --> 00:01:32,335
so it splits right there
and then this becomes

38
00:01:32,335 --> 00:01:34,349
the zero and one in pieces.

39
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:37,301
And then pieces sub one is that host.

40
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:39,905
And if we print that out, we get the host.

41
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:41,438
So that's the double split pattern.

42
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,337
Nice thing about that is you
don't have to keep track,

43
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,644
the little plus one's kind of annoying

44
00:01:45,644 --> 00:01:48,068
to use the space position.

45
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:51,950
That previous one, that's
just hard to remember.

46
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,096
I've written this code way
too many times in my career

47
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:57,215
and I've made mistakes,
and I have to debug it

48
00:01:57,215 --> 00:01:59,204
every single time and I
print all these numbers out.

49
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:01,274
I'm like did I get it right?

50
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:04,030
No, I did it in Python, I did
it in Java, I did it in C.

51
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,469
Wait a second, did it differently.

52
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:08,792
So this is a lot cleaner.

53
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:10,459
I mean I can write this every time

54
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:11,678
and I know it's gonna work every time.

55
00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:15,156
I barely even need to test this
code 'cause it's so obvious.

56
00:02:15,156 --> 00:02:17,673
So double split is another
way of extracting stuff,

57
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:20,079
but if we look at this thing
with the regular expression,

58
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:23,162
we can say, oh okay.

59
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:25,687
Let's use a regular expression to do this.

60
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,666
So we'll start looking through the string.

61
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,244
We'll start so by saying hey, let's look

62
00:02:29,244 --> 00:02:32,427
until we find an at sign.

63
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:36,071
Then let's start extracting
with the parentheses

64
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:39,601
and then once we have found the at sign,

65
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:41,985
let's look for non-blank characters.

66
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:44,759
This is a set of characters.

67
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:50,014
This caret as the first
one means not a blank.

68
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:51,895
So that's another way to do non-blank.

69
00:02:51,895 --> 00:02:53,726
Not a blank, set of characters which are

70
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:55,307
everything but blank.

71
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,347
That's what this little bit is saying.

72
00:02:57,347 --> 00:03:00,478
Star means zero more times which means

73
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:02,584
it's gonna run, run, run, run,
run until it finds a blank

74
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:04,268
which is gonna stop it.

75
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,202
The greediness is what
keeps pushing it, right?

76
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:07,774
This is a greedy match.

77
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:09,025
That asterisks is greedy because

78
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:10,755
there's no question mark after it.

79
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:16,184
And so that does go and
starts at the at sign

80
00:03:16,184 --> 00:03:19,295
with the parenthesis, goes to the space,

81
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:21,775
and that's the end parenthesis
and that's what prints out.

82
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,655
Now Y is gonna be a list.

83
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:26,296
There's a one item list
that has the string in it

84
00:03:26,296 --> 00:03:28,941
that we're looking for
but you just go sub zero

85
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,022
to get that guy right out of there.

86
00:03:31,022 --> 00:03:33,774
Okay, so that's sorta the
regular expression version of it,

87
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:37,803
but we can make this a
more fine tuned thing.

88
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:41,468
So we can say, look we
also wanna pick the line

89
00:03:41,468 --> 00:03:43,646
and we wanna know if there are

90
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:46,523
if we don't get that
line, we wanna skip it.

91
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:48,480
If we do get the line, we
wanna extract the data.

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,154
And we can do this all in a
single, regular expression.

93
00:03:51,154 --> 00:03:54,536
So again, we say start from
the beginning of the line,

94
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:56,925
and it's gotta be a
from followed by a space

95
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:59,853
and then followed by
any number of characters

96
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,370
dot star, followed by an at sign

97
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,358
and so this has to match.

98
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:05,503
We see a space.

99
00:04:05,503 --> 00:04:07,225
Then we're gonna have
any number of characters

100
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:08,820
and then we're gonna see an at sign

101
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,289
and then we're going to start extracting.

102
00:04:11,289 --> 00:04:12,993
Then we're gonna go non-blank,
non-blank, non-blank,

103
00:04:12,993 --> 00:04:16,635
non-blank, non-blank,
up-blank, and extracting,

104
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:17,790
and out that comes.

105
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,853
And this has the advantage
of the previous one

106
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:22,259
in that that makes it much more precise.

107
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,484
There, if we look at the previous one,

108
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:26,162
while it works on good lines,

109
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:28,241
it might actually trigger
on lines that we actually

110
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:31,738
don't wanna see, so this
allows us to refine it

111
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:34,423
so it only actually does this
to lines that we care about.

112
00:04:34,423 --> 00:04:37,295
So it's sort of a both and if statement

113
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:41,049
and a splitting extracting,
going on all at the same time.

114
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:43,568
By having a bigger string
that we're matching

115
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:45,875
than we're extracting.

116
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:48,517
It's a way to kinda clean up your data.

117
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:51,877
So here is a simple program
that we're going to just

118
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:55,097
put all this together and
actually accomplish something.

119
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:59,253
And so we're gonna read through
and look for lines in a file

120
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:00,748
that have this form.

121
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:02,723
And we're gonna extract this number

122
00:05:02,723 --> 00:05:08,545
and then we're going to compute
the maximum of this, okay?

123
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:09,686
And so we're gonna extract this number

124
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,769
and then convert it to a
float and compute the maximum.

125
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,615
So, you know, we're gonna open a file.

126
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,511
We're gonna write a four loop.

127
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,431
We're gonna strip.

128
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:18,952
So we're gonna do this for
every line of the file,

129
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,577
but the first thing we
wanna do is not get light.

130
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:23,622
We're gonna discard all the lines

131
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:24,814
except ones that have this.

132
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:27,297
So our regular expression
is look for lines

133
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:30,556
that start with X dash
DSPAM dash Confidence colon.

134
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:32,032
So that's a pretty strong match.

135
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,742
If that's not there, we're
not gonna get anything.

136
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:37,372
And then there's a space, there's a space.

137
00:05:37,372 --> 00:05:39,626
And then start extracting,

138
00:05:39,626 --> 00:05:44,538
and then go as long, one
or more digits and dots.

139
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:46,925
That's a single character
and that's one or more,

140
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:48,019
and then stop extracting.

141
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,525
So that says start extracting da da da da

142
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:52,806
greedy, greedy, greedy,
greedy, stop extracting.

143
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:54,790
And so that's what we're going to get.

144
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,608
Now, if the line doesn't have this,

145
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,655
and it's missing in some way,

146
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:02,168
whether it's this prefix or this number.

147
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,318
If the number's missing,
it's gonna fail too.

148
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:07,780
We're going to get back
a list, an empty list.

149
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,691
So the first thing you
have to do is check to see

150
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:11,638
if you actually got a match.

151
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,825
So you say if the number
of items in the list

152
00:06:13,825 --> 00:06:16,637
len of stuff is not
equal to one, continue.

153
00:06:16,637 --> 00:06:21,190
And so this is the skip all
the lines that don't match.

154
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,139
Skip, skip, skip, skip, skip, skip.

155
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:25,355
So there could be thousands
of lines that don't match

156
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:28,637
but then when this match
hits, it's gonna come down

157
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,751
and fall through, right?

158
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:34,105
So that, most of the lines will skip up

159
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:35,990
but then when we actually get one,

160
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,990
and we know instantly that we've got one

161
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,071
and stuffs of zero because
that's what we extracted

162
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:43,553
is this number.

163
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,374
And we can take the floating point of it

164
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,625
when you pinned it to our list.

165
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,104
We made a list to store 'em.

166
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:50,563
That runs, the list grows.

167
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:51,720
Choo choo choo choo choo choo.

168
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,655
And then we just say
what was the largest one.

169
00:06:53,655 --> 00:06:57,648
And so you can run this and see that.

170
00:06:57,648 --> 00:07:00,412
We have an escape character
and the whole idea is that

171
00:07:00,412 --> 00:07:02,076
sometimes all these
little special characters

172
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:03,873
that make a lot of sense to us,

173
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:05,008
we actually wanna search for.

174
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,383
So what if we wanna
search for a dollar sign?

175
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:11,109
Well we just prefix it with the backslash.

176
00:07:11,109 --> 00:07:13,285
And that just means this
is a real dollar sign.

177
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:15,470
So backslash dollar is a real dollar sign.

178
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,989
So this says, I would like a dollar sign

179
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:22,471
followed by one or more digits or dots.

180
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,936
And so that's going to match a dollar sign

181
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:26,219
followed by one or more digits.

182
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:28,726
Dots are okay, this is a set, remember?

183
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:31,311
Zero dash nine or dot, that's a set

184
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,752
of the list of legit characters.

185
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,085
This is a range of characters,

186
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:36,499
that's a shortcut to
how it'd make the set.

187
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,380
You could make it be zero,
one, two, three, four,

188
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,672
five, six, seven, eight, nine, dot,

189
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:41,952
or zero dash nine and it assumes that.

190
00:07:41,952 --> 00:07:43,878
And that's one or more so then stops

191
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:45,554
because this is a space.

192
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:47,214
It's greedy matching.

193
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,556
Then it pulls this out.

194
00:07:48,556 --> 00:07:51,053
So that's kinda why greedy
has to be the default

195
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,977
because otherwise if it
wasn't doing greedy matching,

196
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:57,035
Oops, come back, come back.

197
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:59,168
If it wasn't doing greedy matching,

198
00:07:59,168 --> 00:08:01,528
it would

199
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,450
If it wasn't doing greedy
matching, it would stop here

200
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,829
because it would find a dollar sign,

201
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:06,758
non-greedy would find a dollar sign

202
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:09,056
and one character and then
it would give us dollar one

203
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,228
rather than dollar ten.

204
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:15,326
So, in summary, regular
expressions are a cryptic

205
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:19,881
but powerful language and
they're an acquired taste.

206
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:23,407
I think that I bet eventually
you'll find them fun

207
00:08:23,407 --> 00:08:25,513
even though on your first impression,

208
00:08:25,513 --> 00:08:29,926
you might not think that they're so fun.
