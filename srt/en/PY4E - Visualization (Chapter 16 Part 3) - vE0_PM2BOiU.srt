1
00:00:00,315 --> 00:00:01,923
- The last visualization application

2
00:00:01,923 --> 00:00:03,178
that we're going to take a look at

3
00:00:03,178 --> 00:00:05,012
is mailing lists, and
that's kind of ironic.

4
00:00:05,012 --> 00:00:06,655
We started with the mailing lists,

5
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:08,239
and we're gonna end
with the mailing lists.

6
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:09,072
The mailing lists, of course,

7
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:11,713
are from my open-source archive project,

8
00:00:11,713 --> 00:00:14,340
which I love and am very proud of, and,

9
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,302
and so, what we're going to do

10
00:00:16,302 --> 00:00:18,486
is we're going to crawl the
archive of a mailing list,

11
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,254
and then we're going to
do two visualizations.

12
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:22,264
One is a activity visualization,

13
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:24,523
and another is a word cloud.

14
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:28,019
So, probably the more important thing is,

15
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,805
when I do the demonstration
of how the software works.

16
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:34,527
So, this is a large data
set, so you gotta be careful.

17
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:36,030
This could spider gmane.org,

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,594
which is a very free and friendly archive.

19
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:42,502
This data originally came from gmane.org,

20
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:44,048
but I've got a copy of it.

21
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:46,977
And so, gmane.org is not rate-limited,

22
00:00:46,977 --> 00:00:49,705
but if everyone who is watching this

23
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:52,408
starts spidering gmane.org
at the same time,

24
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:53,580
you will crash it.

25
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,812
It just doesn't have the horsepower

26
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:57,732
to give you this data as fast.

27
00:00:57,732 --> 00:00:58,825
And so, I've got something

28
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:00,340
that can give you the data super fast,

29
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,238
and has no rate limit on
it, really good server,

30
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:05,378
and it's cached all around the world

31
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:07,784
using a technology called CloudFlare,

32
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:11,326
so please, please, please,
don't point this at gmane.org,

33
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:13,532
point this at the URL here,

34
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,091
mbox.dr-chuck.net, et cetera et cetera.

35
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:18,946
And then you can run
this as fast as you like.

36
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,942
Now, another thing to worry about

37
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:23,828
is if you,

38
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:25,596
have a metered connection,

39
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:27,642
so don't do this on a
cell phone connection,

40
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:30,841
'cause you'll pay, thousands
of dollars, perhaps.

41
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,664
Make sure you're on a no cost connection,

42
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:34,726
before you start running this,

43
00:01:34,726 --> 00:01:36,723
'cause this is gonna
pull a lot of data down.

44
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:40,862
If you just start this from
scratch, and you let it run, it,

45
00:01:40,862 --> 00:01:44,584
on a super fast connection,
downloading the whole thing

46
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,260
is probably about four hours.

47
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,602
On a, on my home connection,

48
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:53,459
when I had like about 10 meg connection,

49
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:55,296
it took several days.

50
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:58,055
So just understand that, in this one,

51
00:01:58,055 --> 00:02:01,001
it's both fun to deal with a ton of data

52
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:03,553
and it's scary to deal with a ton of data.

53
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:05,458
So this one is big, this one is,

54
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,903
you'll see the process in action

55
00:02:07,903 --> 00:02:10,401
'cause it'll run for a while.

56
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:13,168
Everything you do, the
things will take a long time.

57
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:15,736
So here's basically the flow of the data

58
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:18,093
in this particular one.

59
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,598
You are going to have
the restartable spider

60
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,920
that talks to the API, mbox.dr-chuck.net,

61
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,672
which has a scalable copy
of all this information.

62
00:02:27,672 --> 00:02:32,039
And again, it's going to
do kind of a raw database,

63
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:34,766
not very clean database,
it's sort of a mess.

64
00:02:34,766 --> 00:02:37,009
It's just, just enough
columns to keep track

65
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:39,146
of whether or not we've
got this page or not,

66
00:02:39,146 --> 00:02:41,491
and so, so this has, you know,

67
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:43,393
the ones we've retrieved so far,

68
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:46,259
and so what gmane does
is it sort of scans down

69
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:48,659
to see where to retrieve next, gets that,

70
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:51,671
and then starts scanning,
and then adding things here.

71
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,851
So it just adds it, and then it blows up.

72
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,410
And then it comes in again, and says,

73
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,719
okay, I'll start here, and then
it starts retrieving stuff,

74
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,813
and fills this in, fills
this in, fills this in.

75
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,998
And sometimes you put
like a delay in this,

76
00:03:01,998 --> 00:03:03,735
so you don't overwhelm networks,

77
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:05,012
you don't overwhelm servers,

78
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:06,669
but basically this is pretty much

79
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:10,348
a raw retrieval of the email messages.

80
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:12,242
And this file can get rather large.

81
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,355
This is the one that's
greater than a gigabyte.

82
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:17,632
Now this data is actually really nasty.

83
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,513
It's email data, the date formats change.

84
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:27,775
This is data that lasted from
2004 to like, 2012 or 2013.

85
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:28,791
And so this,

86
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,797
this data has got a lot
of things wrong with it.

87
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:34,720
It even has things where
people's email addresses changed,

88
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,103
and so it has this mapping file,

89
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:39,495
this comes along with it,
this mapping file, it says,

90
00:03:39,495 --> 00:03:42,391
here's this one person, and
here are the six email addresses

91
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:46,005
they used throughout
the life of the project.

92
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:49,555
And so, there is a relatively complex,

93
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:54,166
and so this is, this
part here, is super slow.

94
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:56,008
Very slow.

95
00:03:56,008 --> 00:04:00,043
This part here is slow,
but it'll take like,

96
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:01,229
depending on how fast your computer is,

97
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:03,410
somewhere between two
minutes and ten minutes.

98
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,755
This'll, this first
part'll take days, perhaps,

99
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:08,587
depending on the speed of
your network connection.

100
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:11,302
And so what gmodel does
is it reads through this,

101
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:13,558
it actually recreates it, wipes this out

102
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:16,649
and recreates index.sqlite
every time it runs,

103
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,267
so that you can change any number things,

104
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:21,714
you can respider things,
you can do whatever.

105
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:23,156
And often the cleanup,

106
00:04:23,156 --> 00:04:24,562
this is one of those cleanup processes,

107
00:04:24,562 --> 00:04:26,377
and you have to tweak the cleanup process.

108
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:27,918
You like, look at your data, like, oh!

109
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:30,336
The cleanup missed something,
so I gotta run it again.

110
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,641
So this produces index.sqlite
every time it runs,

111
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,615
so this is like two to ten minutes,

112
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:38,371
gmodel is two to ten minutes.

113
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:40,196
And it, like, maps names.

114
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,918
And when it's all said and done,

115
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,678
this is a very small, highly normalized,

116
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:47,062
it's a nice data model.

117
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:48,104
This one here had the,

118
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:50,125
content.sqlite has the ugly data model.

119
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,574
index.sqlite has a pretty data model.

120
00:04:52,574 --> 00:04:54,830
It's got foreign keys,
it's got all this stuff,

121
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,593
and all those things that we've
talked about in the database

122
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,394
where, it's efficient.

123
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:01,172
And so, in your mind, keep
track of how fast it is

124
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:04,121
to scan all the data in a
database with a bad model,

125
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:07,356
and then watch when you run
like gbasic, which is a scanner,

126
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:09,456
or gline, which produces
line data, or gword,

127
00:05:09,456 --> 00:05:11,140
and watch how fast they run.

128
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,403
They run in like, a couple
of seconds, at the most.

129
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:16,298
And this runs in two to ten minutes.

130
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:17,652
And the, and the difference is,

131
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:20,065
is that's because the data
is efficiently modeled

132
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:21,709
in index.sqlite.

133
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:24,477
So you can take a look at
that using SQLite browser,

134
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:25,676
and take a look at the data model,

135
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:27,957
and you'll see it looks just
like the stuff we talked about

136
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:29,106
in the database chapter.

137
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:32,425
It's got foreign keys,
and, and all those things.

138
00:05:32,425 --> 00:05:34,052
And so that runs, and you got this,

139
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:36,858
and then we do our
visualizations and our analysis

140
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,970
from this clean version of all the data.

141
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,476
And so gbasic just loops through
and prints some stuff out.

142
00:05:41,476 --> 00:05:44,114
It's a great way to test things,

143
00:05:44,114 --> 00:05:45,901
it's a pretty easy to understand program,

144
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:47,102
and you could take a look at it.

145
00:05:47,102 --> 00:05:50,584
gline does some bucketing and
makes a, makes some histograms

146
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:52,489
to produce a line graph.

147
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:55,333
And then gword does a different histogram,

148
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,081
it does a histogram of word frequency,

149
00:05:57,081 --> 00:05:58,268
and then produces that

150
00:05:58,268 --> 00:06:00,629
as the word frequency ends up in gword.js,

151
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:03,016
and then we have two HTML files

152
00:06:03,016 --> 00:06:06,359
that use the d3.js,

153
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:09,954
visualization to produce
a line and a word chart.

154
00:06:09,954 --> 00:06:11,521
And so, you know, I'll,

155
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:14,717
in another video, I'll show
you how this code works,

156
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:17,727
which is probably more
useful than this picture.

157
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:22,956
But this is a whole bunch of good stuff

158
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:25,876
in this particular application, and,

159
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:27,874
if you really understand
everything in here,

160
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:29,735
you can build a pretty sophisticated

161
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:33,032
data retrieval and analysis pipeline.

162
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,621
And so, so that's it.

163
00:06:35,621 --> 00:06:37,550
Thank you for watching all these lectures,

164
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,827
and look forward to
seeing you on the 'Net.
