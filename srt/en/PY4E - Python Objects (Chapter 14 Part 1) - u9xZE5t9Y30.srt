00:00:00,321 --> 00:00:01,728
- Hello and welcome to Python Objects

2
00:00:01,728 --> 00:00:03,002
I'm Charles Severance

3
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:06,481
and we're well on our
way to getting through

4
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:08,764
all this material in the Python.

5
00:00:08,764 --> 00:00:10,907
So this lecture is in a weird place

6
00:00:10,907 --> 00:00:14,557
I even debated where
to put it in the book.

7
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:16,799
I don't really wanna
teach you how to write

8
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:18,312
a lot of object running programming

9
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:20,689
but we're gonna start using objects

10
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:23,552
and I wanna be able to
use the terminology.

11
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,899
So as much as anything,

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,108
this lecture is about terminology

13
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:29,179
and understanding the words.

14
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:31,472
Things like methods and method signatures,

15
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:34,158
and variables and inheritance.

16
00:00:34,158 --> 00:00:36,333
And so think of this as
a terminology lecture,

17
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,008
rather than a learn how to program

18
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:40,117
or learn how to use this.

19
00:00:40,117 --> 00:00:42,760
It's not something you're
gonna figure out right away,

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,195
and there'll come a time
when you as a programmer

21
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,146
really want to start
object runner programming,

22
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,843
it's really a powerful
and wonderful technique.

23
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:53,278
But I think it's too early
as a beginning programmer

24
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:55,353
to really say oh let's
write a bunch of objects.

25
00:00:55,353 --> 00:01:00,611
So just relax and enjoy
and learn this material

26
00:01:00,611 --> 00:01:03,806
and think of it as sort
of a theoretical thing

27
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:09,087
rather than a how to program thing.

28
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:11,437
And so part of this is we're gonna start

29
00:01:11,437 --> 00:01:13,032
reading data structures.

30
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:18,140
And data on how to use all
these libraries etcetera.

31
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,212
And we're gonna see the word objects right

32
00:01:20,212 --> 00:01:21,932
And then we're gonna start hearing them.

33
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:23,233
And I want you to be
able to read the Python

34
00:01:23,233 --> 00:01:26,196
documentation so that you
understand what's going on

35
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:29,723
and the word objects
should make sense to you.

36
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,104
Even though you're not gonna write

37
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:32,613
a lot of object running programming.

38
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:35,482
And so page upon page upon page

39
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:37,913
database stuff which we're
gonna talk about soon.

40
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:38,888
Is a ...

41
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:40,387
Uses objects all over the place.

42
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:43,867
And the beautiful soup uses objects.

43
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:45,240
We kinda been using them

44
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,161
and I've been waving my hands.

45
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:49,345
And I use the word method
without defining it.

46
00:01:49,345 --> 00:01:52,010
But now it's really time to

47
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,766
define it and go to it.

48
00:01:53,766 --> 00:01:55,876
So.

49
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,844
I want to review

50
00:01:57,844 --> 00:01:58,838
from the very beginning

51
00:01:58,838 --> 00:02:00,665
what we think of as a program.

52
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:01,926
So the classic program

53
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:03,598
my favorite little minimum program

54
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:06,387
is our little elevator floor converter.

55
00:02:06,387 --> 00:02:09,386
Which converts from
European elevator floors

56
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:11,597
to United States elevator floors.

57
00:02:11,597 --> 00:02:13,316
And the key to this is that

58
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:15,553
it's input processing and output

59
00:02:15,553 --> 00:02:17,556
and this is a good way to model

60
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:20,022
any program.

61
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:21,561
And in that process

62
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,903
we've got variables

63
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:25,463
and we've got logic we got algorithms.

64
00:02:25,463 --> 00:02:26,674
We got loops that we write.

65
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:28,064
We got all kinds of things.

66
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,657
And we construct a series of steps

67
00:02:30,657 --> 00:02:34,708
to achieve some goal.

68
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:35,858
In Object Oriented

69
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:37,471
and frankly you've been
using Object Oriented

70
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:39,160
all along.

71
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,929
The program has lots of objects.

72
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:43,751
And we're sort of putting
stuff into these objects

73
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:45,217
taking stuff out of one object

74
00:02:45,217 --> 00:02:46,932
and putting it into another object.

75
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:48,750
And you've actually been
doing this all along.

76
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,000
As soon as you're looking
at dictionaries and lists.

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,941
You're doing objects.

78
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:54,906
And so it's

79
00:02:54,906 --> 00:02:57,040
an object is quite a little thing.

80
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,417
It's sort of its own little space

81
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:00,092
inside of a program.

82
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:03,817
That contains code and data.

83
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,895
And so we're working together

84
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,616
all these objects are
now working together.

85
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:10,069
It's a bit of self
contained code and data.

86
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:14,052
And it is one way to take
a very complex problem.

87
00:03:14,052 --> 00:03:15,042
And make it easier

88
00:03:15,042 --> 00:03:17,565
by breaking it into separate things

89
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,911
that can be engineered
and developed separately.

90
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:22,004
And so you've been using string objects

91
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:24,215
or maybe you'd use
beautiful soup or something.

92
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:25,655
These are powerful capabilities.

93
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:27,938
And if you had to look at all of them.

94
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:29,085
It's just hey here's a thing

95
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:30,013
use this object

96
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:31,994
it will do these things for you

97
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,489
and there's lots of details inside of it.

98
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:34,613
Just don't look at it

99
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:35,733
don't worry about it.

100
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:36,849
And so there's boundaries that

101
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,317
things that you can use.

102
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:39,677
Things that you can look at.

103
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,689
And things that really you
don't bother looking at

104
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,218
you go read the documentation and use it.

105
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:45,629
And away it goes.

106
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:47,141
But then someone had to write that

107
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:48,911
and so they built an object.

108
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:50,595
So what we're going to
do is look a little bit

109
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:51,428
under the covers

110
00:03:51,428 --> 00:03:58,189
of what it takes to build
some of these objects.

111
00:03:58,189 --> 00:03:59,770
And so if we think of this program

112
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,156
that originally just
sort of did processing.

113
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:04,635
We can think of it as having
some kind of an input.

114
00:04:04,635 --> 00:04:05,468
Right.

115
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:06,938
Coming into our program.

116
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:08,217
And we have a string object.

117
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:09,216
A dictionary object.

118
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,461
Maybe eventually some objects

119
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:11,835
like a database object.

120
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,079
Or an object that we eventually define.

121
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,068
And you can think of us

122
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:16,134
we're receiving data.

123
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:17,360
It comes in an object.

124
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,374
Which is a string object.

125
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:21,249
We start putting the
strings in dictionaries.

126
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:23,385
And do whatever we pull
out a list of them.

127
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:25,456
And so you can think of data

128
00:04:25,456 --> 00:04:27,117
as moving between these objects.

129
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:28,244
And like I say

130
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:30,579
even strings in the first week

131
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:35,370
first lecture the first
week the first everything.

132
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,203
We were using objects

133
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:38,635
and we've been using them all along.

134
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:40,542
And so you can think of every string

135
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:41,532
and every dictionary

136
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,281
as a little program all by itself

137
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:46,121
that has a bit of code

138
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:48,333
and a bit of data.

139
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,721
And so a string has the data

140
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,017
which includes all the characters

141
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:52,016
that make up the string.

142
00:04:52,016 --> 00:04:54,093
But then there is a method called

143
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,045
upper that does upper case.

144
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:57,366
Or R strip that strips off

145
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:59,577
the white space from the right.

146
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:00,538
And so it's like

147
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:01,724
they're almost little programs

148
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,986
that have inputs and outputs themselves

149
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:05,216
and we can make lots of them.

150
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:07,151
There's lots of cooperating objects

151
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:11,108
that make up an application.

152
00:05:11,108 --> 00:05:12,238
And one of the nice things about

153
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:13,916
the object oriented pattern

154
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:14,858
is that

155
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:17,399
they form boundaries.

156
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,605
And within the boundary

157
00:05:18,605 --> 00:05:19,842
if you're inside the object.

158
00:05:19,842 --> 00:05:21,075
You can say look

159
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:22,765
I'm gonna build you a string object

160
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:23,798
or a database object.

161
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:25,338
Or a beautiful soup object.

162
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:26,670
And I'm gonna build this capability

163
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,599
and I'm gonna give it to you

164
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:29,296
in the form of an interface.

165
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:31,199
And I'm not really gonna
care how you use it.

166
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,206
And so we have this sort of

167
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:34,872
visibility wall where

168
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:36,003
I'm gonna make an object

169
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,471
and I'm gonna let you use it.

170
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,508
And the maker of the object

171
00:05:38,508 --> 00:05:39,498
doesn't necessarily have to know

172
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:41,262
every single thing

173
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:43,385
about the use of that object.

174
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,767
But so just like

175
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:45,783
inside the object

176
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:46,616
they don't have to worry about

177
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:47,591
what you're doing with the object

178
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:48,795
outside of it.

179
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:49,823
When you're outside the object

180
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:50,713
you don't have to worry about

181
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:52,091
what's going on inside of it.

182
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:54,019
We as the user of the object.

183
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,362
We talk to its interface

184
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:56,553
and we get things from it

185
00:05:56,553 --> 00:05:57,435
and give things to it

186
00:05:57,435 --> 00:05:59,818
and use functionality within that object.

187
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,440
But we don't have to look inside of this.

188
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,273
We can just say

189
00:06:02,273 --> 00:06:04,200
oh it's a nice little magical thing.

190
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,324
Read the documentation.

191
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,216
We read a web page

192
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,133
and it told us to do this this and this.

193
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:09,192
And away you go.

194
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:10,025
And so it is a

195
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:12,314
it is sort of this isolation boundary

196
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:14,571
that works both for the

197
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:16,385
programmer who's writing the object.

198
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:19,072
And the programmer who's using the object.

199
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:20,393
And so it's a

200
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:23,340
it's a very nice pattern.

201
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,720
So you'll see how

202
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,624
we're gonna build code

203
00:06:25,624 --> 00:06:26,609
and we're gonna group it together.

204
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:27,856
And then we're gonna be using it

205
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:29,838
sort of as a big

206
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:32,059
blob of stuff.

207
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:32,892
So.

208
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,781
Some definitions in this space.

209
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:39,073
Words that I want you to understand.

210
00:06:39,073 --> 00:06:41,761
When we're gonna create
one of these things.

211
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:43,143
One of these objects.

212
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:44,275
Instances.

213
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:46,018
That has some data in it

214
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:47,295
and some code in it.

215
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,684
We have to be able to define

216
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:49,877
the shape of this object.

217
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:52,074
What code will each object have in it.

218
00:06:52,074 --> 00:06:54,659
And what data will each object have in it.

219
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,707
And that's called a class.

220
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,698
The key to a class.

221
00:06:57,698 --> 00:06:58,634
And this little picture

222
00:06:58,634 --> 00:07:01,040
that I've got up here in all these slides.

223
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,873
Is a key.

224
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:02,974
The class is a template.

225
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:04,126
It's not the thing itself.

226
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:05,272
So it's a cookie cutter.

227
00:07:05,272 --> 00:07:07,951
It knows a lot about how cookies are made.

228
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:09,412
And if you have cookie dough

229
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:10,685
and you hit the thing

230
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,715
then you make as many cookies as you want.

231
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:15,531
And so this nice little cookie picture

232
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,978
is a great you know

233
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:19,980
mental model of how it works.

234
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,884
The class

235
00:07:21,884 --> 00:07:25,866
the class oops.

236
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:28,770
The class is the template

237
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,822
and then the object

238
00:07:30,822 --> 00:07:32,638
are all of the cookies

239
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,209
that are made from that template.

240
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:36,036
But the template defines

241
00:07:36,036 --> 00:07:37,594
the shape and the nature of the class.

242
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:40,712
So the code that we write

243
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:41,835
of each of the objects.

244
00:07:41,835 --> 00:07:43,119
The code we write

245
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:44,414
is the class code.

246
00:07:44,414 --> 00:07:45,452
And then later we say

247
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:46,595
oh lets take that template

248
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:48,737
and make ourselves an object

249
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:49,987
or an instance.

250
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:53,082
Now as we're defining a class.

251
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:55,636
We have two basic things
that we put in the class.

252
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:58,057
And there's a couple of
different terminologies for this.

253
00:07:58,057 --> 00:07:59,866
One is method which is code.

254
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:02,133
It's like a function that
lives inside of a class.

255
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,796
Not a function that lives

256
00:08:03,796 --> 00:08:04,818
inside your program.

257
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,374
But one that lives inside of a class.

258
00:08:06,374 --> 00:08:08,058
And so this is a scoping thing.

259
00:08:08,058 --> 00:08:10,860
A method is really just a function.

260
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,819
But its lived

261
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,251
it lives inside the class.

262
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,780
And then fields or attributes

263
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,345
are data items that are in the class.

264
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:19,234
And so they're variables that
are defined in the class.

265
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:20,887
You can define variables outside the class

266
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:21,826
that you use in your program.

267
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:23,202
You've been doing that all along.

268
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,035
But if you're saying

269
00:08:24,035 --> 00:08:25,194
I'm gonna build this capability

270
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:26,503
and its gonna have data inside of it

271
00:08:26,503 --> 00:08:27,968
and code inside of it.

272
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:29,510
The code is the method or message.

273
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,608
And field or attribute.

274
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:32,155
And.

275
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:34,669
They're just ...

276
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,374
There are just two

277
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:39,370
two different sets of terminology.

278
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:41,106
Method is what I'll probably use.

279
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,039
If you look in some
object oriented patterns

280
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,909
like small talk or

281
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:45,904
apple.

282
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:47,460
They often don't call these messages.

283
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,442
So you can either like

284
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:50,685
access a method inside of a class

285
00:08:50,685 --> 00:08:51,788
or an object.

286
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:54,104
Or you can send a message to the object.

287
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:55,764
The same is true for field and attribute.

288
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:56,964
There's just a chunk of data

289
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:57,892
that's in the object that

290
00:08:57,892 --> 00:08:59,894
you may or may not have

291
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:03,394
the right to access.

292
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:04,508
So like I said

293
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:06,120
a class is a template

294
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,288
it defines the characteristics

295
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:08,619
of the objects that we're gonna

296
00:09:08,619 --> 00:09:09,732
use to make it.

297
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:14,574
It is the cookie cutter.

298
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:17,738
So dog is sort of the exemplar.

299
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:19,141
Lassie is a particular dog.

300
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,473
And so dog has fur

301
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:21,306
and dog barks

302
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:22,559
and dogs do all these things.

303
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,779
And so we know something about dogs

304
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,219
but it doesn't mean we have a dog.

305
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:27,226
Right we ...

306
00:09:27,226 --> 00:09:29,970
In the class is a more abstract concept

307
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,893
that when it's time to get a dog

308
00:09:31,893 --> 00:09:34,802
we know certain things about dogs.

309
00:09:34,802 --> 00:09:37,326
Instances or objects

310
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,886
are once we say

311
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:40,944
oh time to make a cookie

312
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:42,013
from the template.

313
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:43,028
Time to get a dog.

314
00:09:43,028 --> 00:09:44,748
We know something about dogs.

315
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:46,878
That's the creation of an object.

316
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,886
And that we call them instances.

317
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,020
Instance of a class.

318
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,163
So the class is a ...

319
00:09:52,163 --> 00:09:53,436
Doesn't exist.

320
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:55,291
But we say make me a new

321
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,440
object using this class as its template.

322
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,638
Oh and now make me another one.

323
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:00,808
And so we can have many many objects

324
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,755
from one class.

325
00:10:01,755 --> 00:10:03,088
So just like

326
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:06,639
many cookies from one cookie cutter.

327
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,968
Method is a bit of code

328
00:10:07,968 --> 00:10:10,632
that lives inside of an object.

329
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:11,488
It's like a function

330
00:10:11,488 --> 00:10:14,046
but it's scoped to within the object.

331
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,229
Or within the class.

332
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:18,405
Okay so that kind of gets us started

333
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:19,886
on some of the terminology.

334
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:20,719
And we'll come back

335
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:21,552
and we'll take a look at

336
00:10:21,552 --> 00:10:23,968
how we write code

337
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:27,493
that's object oriented.

338
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,910
(jazz music)
