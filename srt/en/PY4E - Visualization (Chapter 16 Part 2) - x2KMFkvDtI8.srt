1
00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:03,014
- So now we are going to
write a search engine.

2
00:00:03,014 --> 00:00:04,965
Doing some of the things
we're gonna do page rank

3
00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:05,940
and we're going to visualize it

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,806
in a web browser and show the weights.

5
00:00:08,806 --> 00:00:11,576
We're really only going to
do page rank on one page

6
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:13,222
because you want to have links that

7
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,571
more than one page that points to a page

8
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,467
so that you can figure out which pages

9
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:19,969
are more or less important
and then visualize it.

10
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:21,579
We'll run the page rank algorithm

11
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,093
and we'll separately do all this.

12
00:00:23,093 --> 00:00:24,908
So at this point we're going to do

13
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,894
pretty much the web
crawling, the index building,

14
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:28,653
and the searching we're not
really going to search it.

15
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,227
We're going to visualize the index

16
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:32,723
but you could write a simple program to do

17
00:00:32,723 --> 00:00:34,916
searches for keywords
and figure which page

18
00:00:34,916 --> 00:00:36,786
was the most likely page for a keyword.

19
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,692
And that would be a fun
additional thing to do.

20
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:41,952
So the web crawler is this program that

21
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:45,760
hits a page, pulls down
the html, parses the page,

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,108
looks for links, make a
queue of incoming links

23
00:00:48,108 --> 00:00:50,330
that are as yet unretrieved.

24
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,610
And I'm going to do this in
a simple SQLite database.

25
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,179
It starts out with the
database basically starts

26
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:57,875
with one link as the starting point

27
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,876
and then it retrieves
that page and then you see

28
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:02,898
the database ends up with
lots of unretrieved pages.

29
00:01:02,898 --> 00:01:04,664
And then it goes back in
and picks a random page,

30
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:08,267
retrieves that one, and then
it just expands and expands.

31
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:09,561
This code that I've built

32
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:10,954
that you're going to play with

33
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:12,643
only stays on one website.

34
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:14,057
Otherwise it would go crazy

35
00:01:14,057 --> 00:01:15,488
and of course google doesn't use

36
00:01:15,488 --> 00:01:17,721
a SQLite database running
on your hard drive.

37
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:19,081
But you'll get the idea.

38
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:23,165
You'll see this thing
exponentially gain links.

39
00:01:23,165 --> 00:01:24,665
And you'll run it for a while,

40
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:27,386
pull down a thousand webpages or whatever.

41
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:29,823
But of course make sure that

42
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,672
you don't violate any terms or conditions

43
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,936
and again I've got some data
sources that you can use.

44
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,773
And they're not rate limited,

45
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:41,069
but you can also use things like Wikipedia

46
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:43,188
which I think they sort of discourage you,

47
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,237
or dr-chuck.com which has no rate limit,

48
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:47,128
or who knows what, right?

49
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:48,720
So just be careful.

50
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,066
Don't do this on you facebook

51
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,313
and don't do this on google.

52
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:52,864
Don't get yourself into trouble.

53
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:54,104
And...

54
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:58,399
if you're using an internet connection

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,135
where you are paying with
bandwidth be careful.

56
00:02:01,135 --> 00:02:03,022
So this is the idea of the web crawler

57
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,020
and this isn't my picture.

58
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,366
This is a classic
picture of a web crawler.

59
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:09,860
Read a page, parse it, take all the URLs

60
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,622
and stick them in a queue,
grab again and again.

61
00:02:13,622 --> 00:02:15,625
So for us the scheduler's going to do it

62
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,048
as long as... you say,
"oh, do a hundred pages."

63
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:19,883
Or it runs until it blows up.

64
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:22,240
And again these processes that have

65
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,400
the network in the loop,
it's really important

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,532
that they behave well when they blow up.

67
00:02:26,532 --> 00:02:28,164
And that's why databases are so useful.

68
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:30,109
Because you can be writing
along to the database

69
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:34,420
and some random thing
happens and blow your data up

70
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,412
and you start over.

71
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:36,724
So you're reading these things,

72
00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:37,961
you're storing each page,

73
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:40,131
building up your storage, etc. etc.

74
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:41,890
So you just keep on doing that.

75
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,249
And with this program,

76
00:02:43,249 --> 00:02:44,979
you'll be able to retrieve some stuff

77
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:46,889
then run the page rank and
then you can retrieve some more

78
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,160
and then you can run some more page rank

79
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,825
and you can kinda see how Google

80
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:53,018
sorta evolves its index over time.

81
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:56,402
Of course we're so much simpler.

82
00:02:56,402 --> 00:02:58,978
And like I said be careful when you crawl.

83
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,103
You're going to run a crawler

84
00:03:00,103 --> 00:03:02,633
that just goes as fast as it can.

85
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:04,247
But Google doesn't do that.

86
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:07,016
It's careful not to
overwhelm any websites.

87
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,671
it's trying to be smart about the use

88
00:03:08,671 --> 00:03:11,784
of your bandwidth on your website.

89
00:03:11,784 --> 00:03:14,457
There is a file,

90
00:03:14,457 --> 00:03:19,175
our code won't bother looking at this.

91
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:20,964
But there's a file called robots.txt

92
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:22,494
that real web crawlers look at

93
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:23,974
and it give a list of the things

94
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:27,100
you're allowed to look at,
and not allowed to look at.

95
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,393
And so if you go to Google and
you see a search that says,

96
00:03:29,393 --> 00:03:32,342
"We're not allowed to
show you the summary text

97
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:35,263
"of this page because of the robots.txt."

98
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:40,317
It's there and you can go
and actually see a robot.txt.

99
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:41,226
Like on a...

100
00:03:41,226 --> 00:03:43,741
Just go to any website,
it's at the top root

101
00:03:43,741 --> 00:03:46,894
blah blah blah blah blah /robot.txt.

102
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,549
It's not a path, it's not slash this,

103
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,858
slash that, slash something else robots

104
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:54,312
it's at the very very top of a website.

105
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:56,822
The index building uses
the page rank algorithm

106
00:03:56,822 --> 00:04:00,882
and the whole goal of the
page rank algorithm is to

107
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:07,079
figure out which pages
have the most best links.

108
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,587
So having the most links is really easy.

109
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:10,476
You can just say how many links go to this

110
00:04:10,476 --> 00:04:12,276
but the problem is that
you got to figure out

111
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:13,564
the value of those links.

112
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:14,823
And then you have to...
how do you figure out

113
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:16,321
the value of those links?

114
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:20,159
By looking at how many
good links comes to it.

115
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:23,288
So it turns out that
it's an infinite problem.

116
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:27,060
It's an infinitely difficult
problem to use page rank.

117
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,617
But you can approximate it

118
00:04:28,617 --> 00:04:30,723
and what happens is after a while

119
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:34,277
it converges to a reasonable value.

120
00:04:34,277 --> 00:04:36,404
And so we're going to run the search index

121
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:39,359
and each time it runs you're
gonna see that it says,

122
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:42,459
"How much did these numbers
change?" and what happens is

123
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,078
in the beginning they change very wildly

124
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:46,745
but quickly they flatten
out. And it has...

125
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,261
The best way to think about...

126
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:52,165
the page rank...

127
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:53,400
is... (sighs)

128
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,297
think about how water runs.

129
00:04:56,297 --> 00:05:01,342
Where you have a small little
stream going by a house

130
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:05,454
and sometimes it rains,
sometimes it's dry,

131
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:08,008
and sometimes...

132
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,801
And there's a little lake

133
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:13,265
and the streams always
running and it doesn't

134
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:14,505
go up and it doesn't go down.

135
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:16,322
It might go up a little
bit if it rains a lot

136
00:05:16,322 --> 00:05:18,851
but in general there's
sort of a steady state

137
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,004
meaning that whatever water coming in is

138
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:23,717
about the same as the water going out.

139
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:26,132
So we think about this
in term of web pages

140
00:05:26,132 --> 00:05:30,067
the value of the links
coming in is roughly the same

141
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,587
as the value of the links going out.

142
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:33,515
So when that starts to balance the

143
00:05:33,515 --> 00:05:36,105
in and the out value
from each of the nodes

144
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:38,897
then you've got pretty stable.

145
00:05:38,897 --> 00:05:41,184
And so what Google does is they have a

146
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:43,138
really relatively stable assessment

147
00:05:43,138 --> 00:05:45,489
of goodness in value of pages

148
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:47,346
and they use that commute page rank.

149
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,914
And then they throw a few more pages in

150
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:50,596
and it kind of has to adjust for a while

151
00:05:50,596 --> 00:05:51,879
but it reconverges.

152
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:56,000
And so this is a calculation
that generally converges

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,326
and it does it very wildly

154
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:00,387
and that's why Google's pretty good at

155
00:06:00,387 --> 00:06:03,510
kind of arriving at the
true value of something.

156
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,711
So let's take a look at

157
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:07,277
what we're going to do
in this application.

158
00:06:07,277 --> 00:06:10,433
Again, we have a file

159
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:13,876
that is going to spider the web

160
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:16,296
and we only have one
database again in this one.

161
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:19,576
We'll have two databases
in the next one and so

162
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:22,629
this is spider... is the restartable part

163
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,654
and what we actually do
is we put one URL in,

164
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:29,038
the starting URL, and then spider walks in

165
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,720
are asks, "Are there
any unretrieved pages?"

166
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,190
And it does that randomly.

167
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,054
It sort of picks among
the unretrieved pages

168
00:06:35,054 --> 00:06:37,822
and says, "Okay, great.
I'll go retrieve that page"

169
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:39,286
"and I'll parse that page

170
00:06:39,286 --> 00:06:42,525
"and then I'll put in a bunch
of new unretrieved pages."

171
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:44,527
Okay? As well as the text of that page

172
00:06:44,527 --> 00:06:46,471
and then a bunch of unretrieved pages.

173
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:48,862
And then it'll go back up and it'll say,

174
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:51,494
"Oh give me one of the
randomly non-retrieved pages."

175
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,637
and it will retrieve the next page

176
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:54,877
and pull that page down
and then add to it.

177
00:06:54,877 --> 00:06:58,244
So this is like there's a
page and then a to do list.

178
00:06:58,244 --> 00:07:00,016
And then this one becomes a page

179
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:02,157
and then adds a few more
things to the to do list.

180
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:04,451
So the to do list, or
the unretrieved URLs,

181
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:08,429
grows very rapidly.

182
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,395
And the retrieved ones grow sort of as

183
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:11,755
you would retrieve them one at a time.

184
00:07:11,755 --> 00:07:13,642
But you've always got this long list.

185
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,041
If you have a really short site

186
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,379
that only has like two links,

187
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,558
if you start at dr-chuck.com/page1.htm

188
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,371
it will go to page two and
then go back to page one

189
00:07:22,371 --> 00:07:23,204
and it will be out of things.

190
00:07:23,204 --> 00:07:25,787
It will have retrieved all of the pages.

191
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:27,909
So if you had a website
that has no external links

192
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:30,181
or has a very few pages and
they point to each other

193
00:07:30,181 --> 00:07:32,428
this will run out of things to do.

194
00:07:32,428 --> 00:07:35,296
But if you go to a page like my blog,

195
00:07:35,296 --> 00:07:37,877
or the code... sample stuff

196
00:07:37,877 --> 00:07:40,084
that I have up for you
for spider for testing,

197
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,538
on dr-chuck.net.

198
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:43,945
It'll run for a very long time.

199
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:46,098
And you'll have far more pages to retrieve

200
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,416
than pages you have retrieved.

201
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,823
But that's okay, at some
point you can stop this.

202
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:52,693
Maybe it stops because
you ran out of bandwidth,

203
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:55,600
or maybe your computer went
down, or who knows what, right?

204
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,894
But it's okay, this is
a restartable process

205
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,394
because it always has some
pages that are retrieved

206
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:01,725
and some unretrieved pages.

207
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:02,688
You start it back up,

208
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:04,794
it picks randomly from
the unretrieved pages.

209
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:08,958
The database is sort of the
persistent state of your spider

210
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,721
rather than a bunch of dictionaries

211
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:12,033
or lists inside the python

212
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,071
which go away when the program dies.

213
00:08:15,071 --> 00:08:17,335
And so at some point you have...

214
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:19,198
Let's just say a few hundred pages in here

215
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:21,248
and a few thousand unretrieved pages.

216
00:08:21,248 --> 00:08:23,729
You can run the page rank algorithm.

217
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:24,919
And what the page rank algorithm does

218
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:26,329
is that it loops through all of the pages

219
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:28,945
and figures out which pages
are linked to which pages

220
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:31,852
and then reads the numbers
and then updates the numbers.

221
00:08:31,852 --> 00:08:34,716
And then does that some number of times.

222
00:08:34,716 --> 00:08:35,888
And so this is where the numbers...

223
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:39,231
All the pages sorta start
out with a goodness of one.

224
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:41,645
I think this printout is
showing that goodness of one,

225
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,254
and then it changes...

226
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,305
and then the goodness goes to...

227
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:46,721
some of the goodness goes up to two,

228
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:49,326
some of it goes to seven, and whatever,

229
00:08:49,326 --> 00:08:50,792
but then it does this over and over

230
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,289
and it uses these numbers
and then they change again.

231
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:55,374
And so there's a number of time steps

232
00:08:55,374 --> 00:08:58,232
that this page rank runs and you will see,

233
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:01,136
as the page rank runs,
when I show you the code

234
00:09:01,136 --> 00:09:06,076
you'll see the average sort
of change in these numbers

235
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:07,655
across all these things
and you'll see that

236
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:10,806
the average goes down very
rapidly as you get through.

237
00:09:10,806 --> 00:09:13,685
So usually with a few hundred
or a few thousand pages

238
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:16,767
like a hundred plus times
to run this algorithm

239
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:18,990
and these numbers have converged.

240
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,740
And that's when you sort of
can begin to trust the numbers.

241
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,259
Now there's this one
program called spreset

242
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,903
which sets all the pages back to one.

243
00:09:26,903 --> 00:09:28,535
So you can start this over.

244
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,660
So if you were to spider for a while,

245
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,773
run sprank for a while, play around,

246
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,799
and then you wanted to spider some more

247
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,436
and start it over, you could say,

248
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:38,468
"Oh, let's start the page
rank completely over."

249
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:43,919
Or you could simply take the
new pages and watch it adapt.

250
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,607
Either way this is just a
way to reset all the pages

251
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:50,768
to have sorta their initial
value of a goodness of 1.0.

252
00:09:50,768 --> 00:09:52,368
So at some point you run this,

253
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:55,985
this runs really... this
part here runs really slow.

254
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:58,698
This part runs super fast
like in a blink of an eye.

255
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,791
This one is pretty fast.

256
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:04,814
And then at some point you got these pages

257
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:06,800
that have numbers on them.

258
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,437
They have values on the pages.

259
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:10,364
And there's a couple programs

260
00:10:10,364 --> 00:10:12,505
that allow us to visualize that.

261
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:14,502
One is the dump which just reads it

262
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:16,575
and checks to see that it shows up,

263
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,500
the new page rank, the old page rank,

264
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,274
and various of other things.

265
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:22,728
It shows just a way to dump it

266
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:25,897
and then there's this thing
that read the whole thing.

267
00:10:25,897 --> 00:10:28,972
You'd say you'd like to do
25 of the top, the best,

268
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:32,016
it sorts it by page rank and
it produces a java script file

269
00:10:32,016 --> 00:10:33,792
that has just the numbers in it.

270
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:35,969
And then there is some HTML

271
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,842
and a visualization library called d3.js,

272
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:40,131
which you can read about,

273
00:10:40,131 --> 00:10:42,273
that when the HTML starts it reads this

274
00:10:42,273 --> 00:10:46,104
and has this nice force direct
layout of the page rank.

275
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,186
And you can hover over
things and you can see

276
00:10:48,186 --> 00:10:50,987
what page rank you've got.

277
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:52,263
And so...

278
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:55,171
And so that is the page rank algorithm

279
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,499
that we are going to do.

280
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:58,465
And up next we'll do the largest

281
00:10:58,465 --> 00:10:59,947
and most complex of these things

282
00:10:59,947 --> 00:11:01,764
and that is the email.

283
00:11:01,764 --> 00:11:03,082
We're going to spider some email

284
00:11:03,082 --> 00:11:07,497
which is about a gigabyte of data. Okay?

285
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:10,329
(slow jazz music)
