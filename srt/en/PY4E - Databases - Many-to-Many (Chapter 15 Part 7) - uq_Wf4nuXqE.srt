1
00:00:00,576 --> 00:00:01,982
- So our last major topic is called

2
00:00:01,982 --> 00:00:03,567
many to many relationships.

3
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:05,604
So up to now everything that we've done

4
00:00:05,604 --> 00:00:07,741
is what's called a one
to many relationship,

5
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:10,915
and that is there are many tracks

6
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:12,377
associated with one album.

7
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:14,963
There are many albums
associated with one artist.

8
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:18,115
There are many tracks
associated with one genre,

9
00:00:18,115 --> 00:00:20,228
and you can think of labeling and as

10
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,839
you look at data models they put

11
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,011
little labels on each arrow that

12
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:25,203
tell you which end of the arrow

13
00:00:25,203 --> 00:00:26,856
is the many and which end of the

14
00:00:26,856 --> 00:00:29,196
arrow is the one, and so in this

15
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,368
case the Foreign key is pointing to.

16
00:00:31,368 --> 00:00:33,492
There are many of these rows over here,

17
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,038
many rows that point to one row over here.

18
00:00:36,038 --> 00:00:38,118
So it's a many to one relationship.

19
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:39,715
There are various ways, sometimes

20
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:42,013
they'll put two arrows at this end

21
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:43,517
and one arrow at that end, but

22
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:45,700
whatever it is, this kind of thing we've

23
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,028
been showing is the many
to one relationship,

24
00:00:48,028 --> 00:00:49,874
and that's probably the most common thing,

25
00:00:49,874 --> 00:00:53,384
but there are times when you just can't

26
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:57,726
model things with the
one to many relationship.

27
00:00:57,726 --> 00:00:59,962
So like if you have a mother and children

28
00:00:59,962 --> 00:01:02,202
well that's a many to one relationship,

29
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:04,605
and it's just fine and it works fine,

30
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:07,950
but sometimes you have a
many to many relationship

31
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,002
in that there might be many books.

32
00:01:11,002 --> 00:01:12,483
One book has many authors and

33
00:01:12,483 --> 00:01:15,026
each author has many books so you

34
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:17,939
don't have the one side, there's no one.

35
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:20,268
So you have to end up building

36
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:22,147
a table that what we call, I'll call it

37
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:24,296
a connector table, they
call it a junction table,

38
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,739
on Wikipedia, but we need a little table

39
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:29,955
that allows us to break a
many to many relationship

40
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:32,813
into into an effect, two
many to one relationships

41
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:34,918
in a connector table, and so this

42
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:36,278
is a connector table.

43
00:01:36,278 --> 00:01:38,235
So you could think of this as, you know,

44
00:01:38,235 --> 00:01:40,126
there are many, many links here,

45
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:42,408
but we don't have a way to model

46
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:45,346
the Many over here to here so

47
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:47,157
what you do is you basically say

48
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:48,879
oh there's a lot of these things.

49
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,633
There's many that go to the one.

50
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:52,253
The many that go to the one, and

51
00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:53,984
then in here you'd sort of create

52
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:56,596
that manyness that you want to create.

53
00:01:56,596 --> 00:01:58,035
So it's probably just as easy

54
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:00,868
to look at a sample of this.

55
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:04,763
So let's imagine a
learning management system

56
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:06,505
where you're taking a class and

57
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:08,274
there's some people that are teachers

58
00:02:08,274 --> 00:02:09,727
and som people that are students

59
00:02:09,727 --> 00:02:13,012
and many students are
members of many classes.

60
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:15,253
A student can be part of many classes

61
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:17,726
and a class has many students in it

62
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:19,682
so you can't really find the one end,

63
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,493
and so what we do is
we make a table called

64
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,392
membership and in that table

65
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:25,397
of membership we actually often

66
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:27,298
don't put a primary key at all.

67
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:30,049
We simply put in two foreign keys,

68
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,443
and if we're going to put a uniqueness

69
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:34,502
constraint, we put a combination of

70
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:38,129
the two foreign keys as
the uniqueness constraint.

71
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,963
So we say there could be duplicate

72
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:42,583
user id's and duplicate course id's

73
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,452
but there can only be, you know,

74
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:46,443
user id, course id combinations.

75
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:47,523
That has to be unique.

76
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:52,494
So you can make unique
be more than one column.

77
00:02:52,494 --> 00:02:54,528
And so if you imagine a course table

78
00:02:54,528 --> 00:02:56,463
and a user table, there's a user id,

79
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:57,984
the name and email, and the course has

80
00:02:57,984 --> 00:02:59,602
a title and an id, and then we

81
00:02:59,602 --> 00:03:01,076
have this little table that's just

82
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:03,944
is the connector table that shows the,

83
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:07,398
it points out so we can
expand this membership.

84
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:09,581
So let's take a look at how that works.

85
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:18,413
So we're going to create some tables...

86
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:19,727
and these are very classic tables

87
00:03:19,727 --> 00:03:22,404
because these are the one end of it.

88
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:23,901
So these are the one end of it.

89
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,847
So it has a primary key, a title,

90
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:28,691
a logical key, email,
there's a primary key

91
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,326
here for course, and then there's text.

92
00:03:30,326 --> 00:03:32,192
So we add this unique to kind of indicate

93
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:33,428
that it is a logical key.

94
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:34,723
We're not even going to allow ourselves

95
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:36,851
to put any duplicates in here.

96
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,425
Now that the connector database here

97
00:03:39,425 --> 00:03:42,500
is a table member, and it has

98
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,297
two foreign keys, user id and course id,

99
00:03:45,297 --> 00:03:47,591
and you can model some data here.

100
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,359
So I'm going to model role which

101
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,853
is going to be zero equals student

102
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,916
and one equals instructor, and then

103
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,027
I'm going to indicate that the

104
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:56,827
primary key, or uniqueness constraint

105
00:03:56,827 --> 00:04:00,565
is the combination of the
user id and a course id.

106
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:02,161
Now when we say the primary key

107
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:05,499
it both limits our ability to

108
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:07,427
insert duplicates but it also

109
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,081
allows the database to optimize it

110
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,937
scanning because it knows that that

111
00:04:10,937 --> 00:04:12,964
combination is always unique and so

112
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:15,449
it can organize its disk structure

113
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,238
and storage structure to understand

114
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,353
how to look things up more efficiently

115
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:21,962
and knowing that once it's found

116
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,524
a user id, course id combination

117
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:24,741
it doesn't have to look any farther

118
00:04:24,741 --> 00:04:25,833
because they're unique, and so

119
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,587
all of these contracts that we add

120
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:30,252
speed things up, save storage, and

121
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:31,874
makes things more efficient, but in ways

122
00:04:31,874 --> 00:04:34,426
we don't always know
exactly how they happen,

123
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:38,286
and so let's go ahead and make these.

124
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:40,559
Let's go ahead and make these guys.

125
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:43,621
I think I will start with a new database.

126
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:49,010
I'm going to call it LMS for
Learning Management System.

127
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,226
No I don't really want to do that one,

128
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:55,051
and so I'm going to not create the table.

129
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:57,402
I'm going to do everything in SQL,

130
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:59,666
and so let me see if
it's in my cheat sheet.

131
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,520
No that's not in my cheat sheet,

132
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,377
so I'll have to fix the
cheat sheet again for you.

133
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:04,637
By the time you see the cheat sheet

134
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,313
all these things will be in there.

135
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:07,819
So I'm going to go in here and

136
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:12,521
I'm going to grab create table user.

137
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,256
Actually, I'm going to grab them all.

138
00:05:14,256 --> 00:05:17,000
Watch this.

139
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,026
Grab them all.

140
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:20,903
Highlight all of these.

141
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,120
Go over to my SQL browser.

142
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,100
Blast them all in, and then I'll

143
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,193
put a semicolon at the end of

144
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:31,258
each one of the statements,

145
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:35,691
and I want to run them.

146
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:38,620
So did I, does it look good?

147
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,768
Yep, yep, yep.

148
00:05:39,768 --> 00:05:41,331
So I've got a course.

149
00:05:41,331 --> 00:05:43,269
I've got membership, two foreign keys,

150
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:46,416
and I've got user, so that all looks good.

151
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:47,484
Okay?

152
00:05:47,484 --> 00:05:53,236
So now we're going to have
to insert some data in.

153
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:55,518
Now we're going to insert
from the outside in,

154
00:05:55,518 --> 00:05:56,406
and so we're just going to put

155
00:05:56,406 --> 00:05:57,926
the name and email, the id will

156
00:05:57,926 --> 00:06:00,580
be automatically assigned for the users,

157
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,043
and we're going to do the same thing

158
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:03,754
and the id and the courses

159
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:05,531
will be automatically assigned.

160
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,919
So let me just grab all of this stuff.

161
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,126
Go into SQL, that has the semicolons

162
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:13,373
at the end already for me.

163
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,779
Thank you very much.

164
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:17,229
Now I'm going to run it, and if

165
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:18,930
I take a look at my data, now

166
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,851
I've got primary keys for the courses

167
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:24,926
and I've got primary keys for the users,

168
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,200
and I've got nothing in
the membership table,

169
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,425
and I have course have to remember

170
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,225
what these values are because Jane

171
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,208
is one, and Ed is two,
and Sue is three, right?

172
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:38,101
And Python is one,
SQL's two, PHP is three,

173
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:40,103
and so when I go into membership

174
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:41,534
I've got two foreign keys here

175
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,467
and role and they just have to be

176
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,875
for the course, person combination,

177
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,486
and so it's a little tricky to

178
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:50,509
figure all of this stuff out, but again

179
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,198
these are just numbers and if you

180
00:06:52,198 --> 00:06:55,123
look at these numbers,
user id, course id, role.

181
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,225
Well user id one is in course one.

182
00:06:57,225 --> 00:06:59,477
User id is in course as the teacher.

183
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:02,222
User id is in course one as the student,

184
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,378
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

185
00:07:03,378 --> 00:07:04,573
So I'm making these connections

186
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:06,879
by just putting these little numbers in

187
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:08,974
and once again, conveniently,

188
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:11,921
I have all of my semicolons
perfectly in place.

189
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:15,020
So I go to SQL...

190
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,566
and then I run that...

191
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,626
and then I take, and I look at my

192
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,548
membership data and there it is.

193
00:07:21,548 --> 00:07:23,582
So two foreign keys and a bit of data

194
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:24,900
modeled at the connection.

195
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,181
That's the way we say that.

196
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:29,196
The role is modeled at the connection.

197
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:30,792
So now that we've built
all of this stuff up

198
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:32,574
we can write some queries that

199
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:35,655
take a look at this, and so what

200
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,386
we're going to do is look at who's

201
00:07:37,386 --> 00:07:40,504
in what course and what role are they

202
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:43,891
and we're going to sort
this in a nice way.

203
00:07:43,891 --> 00:07:45,615
So let's just take a quick look

204
00:07:45,615 --> 00:07:47,415
at the code we're writing.

205
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:48,765
We're going to do a select from

206
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:50,768
three tables, the user name, the

207
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:53,760
member role, the course title.

208
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,627
So in effect we're not showing any

209
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:57,746
of the foreign keys or the primary keys.

210
00:07:57,746 --> 00:07:59,541
We're going to go from the user table

211
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,544
joined to the member table
joined to the course table.

212
00:08:01,544 --> 00:08:03,626
This is pretty easy to write.

213
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:04,772
You know there are three tables

214
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:05,809
you want to go across.

215
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:09,555
The on clause is also
very easy to write, right?

216
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:12,166
The on clause models
each of these connections

217
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:16,039
where the member's user id...

218
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,639
is equal

219
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,239
to the user's id and where the member's

220
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:24,344
course id is equal to the course id.

221
00:08:24,344 --> 00:08:26,517
So we're going to concatenate all

222
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:27,910
three of these tables together

223
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,566
but we're only going to
keep rows where it matters.

224
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:33,715
Now this role doesn't participate,

225
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:35,480
but we're going to print that out,

226
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,226
and we're going to order it by

227
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:39,860
the course title, first, and then

228
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,008
the member role, second, and the

229
00:08:42,008 --> 00:08:56,476
the name, third, and so let's run that.

230
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:57,625
So we've reconnected it.

231
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,513
So Ed's the teacher of the PHP class.

232
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:00,944
Sue is the student in the PHP class.

233
00:09:00,944 --> 00:09:02,843
Jane is the teacher in the Python class.

234
00:09:02,843 --> 00:09:05,265
Ed's a student and Sue's a
student in the Python class.

235
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:07,355
Ed's the teacher in the SQL class

236
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:10,279
and Jane is the student in the SQL class,

237
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:13,430
and so we have many people, there

238
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,093
are many students in many classes

239
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:17,413
and so we have modeled that, but

240
00:09:17,413 --> 00:09:19,967
we have modeled that
with this sort of table,

241
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,215
and if you look at a piece of

242
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:22,495
software that I've written called

243
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,735
Tsugi which is a stand alone learning

244
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,332
management system, that's built

245
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,864
with learning tools, you will see

246
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:29,720
in anything we're in membership

247
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,717
or we have a...

248
00:09:32,717 --> 00:09:33,879
we have a user table.

249
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:36,056
We have a context which
is also the course table,

250
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,396
and then we have a membership table,

251
00:09:37,396 --> 00:09:39,173
and look, here's these foreign keys.

252
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:40,636
It's kind of like that's the many side,

253
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:42,604
that's the one side, many to one,

254
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:45,471
and so this, you know, this is now

255
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,504
in effect a many to many between

256
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,045
these two but then it's modeled

257
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:53,272
as a series of many to one, many to one,

258
00:09:53,272 --> 00:09:54,896
relationships, and you see this

259
00:09:54,896 --> 00:09:56,987
all of the time in all kinds of things

260
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:59,507
where membership or other kinds of things

261
00:09:59,507 --> 00:10:03,985
are necessary in many
to one or many to many.

262
00:10:03,985 --> 00:10:07,605
So, with all of that,
there's so much to learn.

263
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:10,589
It's both easy and
complex at the same time.

264
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:11,814
It's easy when someone shows you

265
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:13,311
how to do it, but at some point

266
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,064
you will learn how to
build database models

267
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:16,914
and you'll realize oh it wasn't so bad.

268
00:10:16,914 --> 00:10:18,452
It takes a while to get used to them.

269
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:22,478
This really just is quick walk.

270
00:10:22,478 --> 00:10:26,161
The bottom line is, what we just did

271
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:29,972
seems like it was, while that's nice,

272
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:31,277
do you really have to do that?

273
00:10:31,277 --> 00:10:32,919
And the answer is, if you're going to

274
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,934
scale at all, you absolutely have to

275
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,676
because you simply can't read

276
00:10:36,676 --> 00:10:38,433
and write data sequentially.

277
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:40,525
You can't read through, update one

278
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:42,212
little piece of data in a file

279
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:43,338
by reading all the way through

280
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:44,798
and then writing a new copy of the file.

281
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:47,793
That could take seconds in a system

282
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:49,457
like an online system you get a

283
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:51,472
hundredth of a second to
do something like that

284
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:53,260
and the databases make it so that happens

285
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,779
at a thousandth of a second.

286
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,917
So ultimately you simply have to

287
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:57,952
take advantage of this.

288
00:10:57,952 --> 00:11:00,448
You just can't, if you're
going to modify data,

289
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:01,968
you can read data from flat files,

290
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,530
but even if you're going
to read a lot of data,

291
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,670
if it's big, it slows it down terribly.

292
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,033
So it might seem like there's a trade off,

293
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:10,686
that you could debate
whether this is worth it,

294
00:11:10,686 --> 00:11:12,892
but if you're going to
deal with a lot of data,

295
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:14,661
you've got no choice.

296
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:17,742
It's really not as much
a trade off as you think.

297
00:11:17,742 --> 00:11:21,556
So this has been a quick
run up through databases.

298
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,717
We talked a little bit about indexes.

299
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:24,896
There are constraints.

300
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,673
We talked a little bit
about the not, null stuff.

301
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:27,909
We've talked about that,

302
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:29,870
the uniqueness, that's a constraint.

303
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,390
Another whole area is what's called

304
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,387
transactions, and that's the locking

305
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:36,615
a little area so you can read an area,

306
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:38,178
then lock it, and update it to

307
00:11:38,178 --> 00:11:39,763
make sure nobody else reads it,

308
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:41,452
and so they make sure they either

309
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:45,051
get the version before you looked at it,

310
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,099
or before you changed it,
or after you change it.

311
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,799
So that's how you make sure you can't

312
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,973
do things, having to do with bank account

313
00:11:53,973 --> 00:11:56,933
balances, and get yourself in trouble.

314
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:58,542
So these are a lot of SQL.

315
00:11:58,542 --> 00:11:59,517
It's really fascinating.

316
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:01,894
SQL is a fascinating thing to use

317
00:12:01,894 --> 00:12:05,345
and learn and performance tune and enjoy.

318
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:08,811
So relational databases are cool.

319
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,082
This gets us started.

320
00:12:10,082 --> 00:12:14,033
The big thing is don't allow replication

321
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,359
vertically of string data.

322
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,798
Pull that out into a separate table,

323
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:18,510
establish a primary key, and then

324
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,088
have foreign keys that
point to that primary key.

325
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:23,641
It is not just how much data you store,

326
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:25,407
it's sort of a compression way

327
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:26,597
as a way of compressing data.

328
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:29,841
You might think strings
take no data but they do.

329
00:12:29,841 --> 00:12:31,752
Numbers take a lot less data and it's

330
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,440
both how much data that's stored

331
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,331
but also how much data has to be scanned,

332
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:38,334
and that way joins work.

333
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:39,740
That's part of the magic of why

334
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,373
Oracle's such a successful company.

335
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:44,047
It's a bit of an art form and it's

336
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,164
something that you can
work your whole life

337
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:51,292
and always get better at.
