1
00:00:00,848 --> 00:00:02,068
- So, now we're going to take a look at

2
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:04,778
how we deal with more than
one table, multiple tables,

3
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:06,958
because the real power of SQL

4
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:08,638
and the power of database performance

5
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:11,059
has to do with when you start
connecting tables together.

6
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:12,890
If you go back to that
original mathematics,

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,719
it models data at the intersections

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,388
between the row and the columns,

9
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:21,718
and these intersections
are the magical bits.

10
00:00:21,718 --> 00:00:24,117
Breaking an application
to use multiple tables

11
00:00:24,117 --> 00:00:26,538
is an art form, it takes a while.

12
00:00:26,538 --> 00:00:29,699
There are some simple basic
things that you can learn,

13
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,458
and we'll teach you here.

14
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,317
It's not to hard to learn the basics,

15
00:00:33,317 --> 00:00:38,756
but then it's much more complex
to be super skilled at it.

16
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:40,879
In general, advanced
databases, in my mind,

17
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:43,835
it's hard to teach advanced databases

18
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:48,371
because they're always
so contextually grounded.

19
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:51,727
Something like a Twitter or Google,

20
00:00:51,727 --> 00:00:55,620
the databases are so specialized.

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,347
Everyone can do
small-to-medium sized databases

22
00:00:57,347 --> 00:00:59,548
using the basic techniques,
but at some point,

23
00:00:59,548 --> 00:01:01,936
once you escape medium sized databases,

24
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,739
you end up in these sort-of narrow things,

25
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:06,778
and optimize each
database very separately.

26
00:01:06,778 --> 00:01:10,176
I just tell people, learn the
basics really, really well,

27
00:01:10,176 --> 00:01:14,395
write programs, and then go do real work.

28
00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:20,753
But, database design is
the act of figuring out

29
00:01:20,753 --> 00:01:23,394
the data that your application
is going to want to store,

30
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:25,626
and spreading that across multiple tables.

31
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:26,744
But, we don't just do it randomly,

32
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:28,893
we do it very much cleverly.

33
00:01:28,893 --> 00:01:31,846
If you look at a data model,
this is what it looks like.

34
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:34,714
What we're showing here
in this data model,

35
00:01:34,714 --> 00:01:38,594
is we are showing five tables,

36
00:01:38,594 --> 00:01:41,555
and this is a calendar system.

37
00:01:41,555 --> 00:01:44,694
We're seeing the columns that
are in each of the tables,

38
00:01:44,694 --> 00:01:47,822
and then we're seeing the
relationships between the tables.

39
00:01:47,822 --> 00:01:49,145
And, even in these relationships,

40
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:51,135
there's a little bit of code,

41
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:52,973
and when you have an arrow
that looks like that,

42
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:54,416
there's many of those to one,

43
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,982
and this is a many-to-one relationship.

44
00:01:57,982 --> 00:01:58,950
Many-to-one relationship.

45
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,012
We'll talk all about that stuff, but--

46
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:02,424
If you go into an organization,

47
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:05,553
and you have a really large
and complex data application,

48
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:07,233
they might have something
printed out on the wall

49
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,532
that looks about like this,

50
00:02:08,532 --> 00:02:12,546
which shows the database tables
and the connections, etc.

51
00:02:12,546 --> 00:02:13,379
And, they might say,

52
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:15,618
"Oh, you're job is to go
down into this little corner

53
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:17,660
"and add one column field
there, and then do this,

54
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,896
"and then connect it with
this thing over there,

55
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:22,249
"and then make a screen
that shows all these things

56
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:25,417
"that pulls from this table,
this table, and that table,"

57
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:27,880
and that's your job if you're a programmer

58
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,938
on a large software development project.

59
00:02:30,938 --> 00:02:34,840
These database models
become the core backbone

60
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,217
of the knowledge that applications
are managing and using.

61
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:43,170
So, the idea is that you
take your application,

62
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,369
we're gonna start really simple.

63
00:02:44,369 --> 00:02:45,826
We're going to take your application,

64
00:02:45,826 --> 00:02:48,830
and you have to draw a
picture, and the basic rule--

65
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,528
And, literally, you could
spend course upon course

66
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:54,644
learning about database normalization,

67
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:57,375
but I'm going to distill
it into one basic rule,

68
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:01,726
and that is, never put the
same string data in twice.

69
00:03:01,726 --> 00:03:06,176
So, my name, Charles Severance,
if I build a database well,

70
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:08,123
you should go into that
database, and you'd say,

71
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:09,615
"Okay, the words Charles Severance,

72
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:12,654
"which is the name of a
person, me, in that database,

73
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:14,404
"only shows up once."

74
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:17,303
And, what we do instead is
we connect things together

75
00:03:17,303 --> 00:03:20,125
and model my name as
connection to the record

76
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:21,904
that has my actual name in it,

77
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:24,222
rather than putting my name
all these other places.

78
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:27,106
So, the idea is to pull
duplicate data out,

79
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,584
and make only one copy of it.

80
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:32,226
So, there is the users, and
in there is the user's name,

81
00:03:32,226 --> 00:03:34,954
and the username shows up only here,

82
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:38,385
and everything else points
to the particular user entry.

83
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,574
So, that's the idea.

84
00:03:41,574 --> 00:03:44,036
Here's our first application.

85
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:48,204
We are working as a start-up,
we just quit all of our jobs,

86
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:51,736
and we are going to build a
music management application.

87
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:52,865
I mean, what a great idea.

88
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:55,115
Don't you think that
will be quite successful?

89
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,354
And, so we have mocked up,

90
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:58,035
and we have figured out that this

91
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:00,275
is what our music management application--

92
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:04,173
We wanna track people's
tracks, know something about

93
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:06,545
what artists and albums
and genre they are,

94
00:04:06,545 --> 00:04:07,415
we're going to have ratings,

95
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:09,714
and how many times we've played
them, and how long they are.

96
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:13,125
That's the data that our
application needs to represent.

97
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,693
And, we've done testing
on this, and wire-frames,

98
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:18,535
and everyone loves this,
a great user interface.

99
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:21,005
And, so this is how it's gotta look.

100
00:04:21,005 --> 00:04:23,675
But, we're going to have
billions and billions of tracks

101
00:04:23,675 --> 00:04:25,524
in these things, and so
we want to come up with

102
00:04:25,524 --> 00:04:28,096
an efficient database to handle this.

103
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:29,715
We're going to take a look at this,

104
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:31,416
and look at each of the columns

105
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,975
and we're going to ask ourselves,

106
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:37,826
"Is this column part of one
of our existing objects,

107
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:41,663
"our existing tables, or is this object--

108
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:43,372
"have to create a new table."

109
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:45,561
And then, once we've defined
those different objects,

110
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:48,443
we connect the tables together
and model the connections.

111
00:04:48,443 --> 00:04:52,044
Now, a little trick to make it
a little easier on ourselves,

112
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:54,172
is we can look in these columns

113
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:55,234
and look in the columns that have

114
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:58,633
duplicate information vertically
that's string information.

115
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:01,602
So, rating is just a number like 0-5,

116
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,104
so we don't worry too much
about integers and numbers,

117
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:07,453
and that kind of stuff,
but we do look for strings.

118
00:05:07,453 --> 00:05:11,203
And the problem here, is these
strings occur many times.

119
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:12,691
And so, these are the problems,

120
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:14,823
and so we have to put these things

121
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:17,023
where there is replication of string data

122
00:05:17,023 --> 00:05:18,924
in the vertical dimension.

123
00:05:18,924 --> 00:05:22,314
We have to put those in different tables.

124
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:24,053
We'll start out.

125
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:26,372
Now, the first question that
you have to ask yourself

126
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:27,524
when you're going to draw this picture

127
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:29,382
of how this data is in multiple tables

128
00:05:29,382 --> 00:05:30,812
and connected together,

129
00:05:30,812 --> 00:05:33,953
is what is the first one that
you're going to write down.

130
00:05:33,953 --> 00:05:35,474
And, this is an interesting debate,

131
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:37,024
and often people are sitting
in a conference room,

132
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:39,874
and people who have experience
kinda know what to do.

133
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:42,643
Usually, if it's a multi-user system,

134
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,491
like a learning management system,

135
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:46,913
the users might be central concept.

136
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,372
Perhaps the courses might
be the central concept.

137
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:52,114
This is a single-user
system, and so you can think,

138
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:54,819
"Well, what is really
this application about."

139
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:57,423
It's not about people, it's one person.

140
00:05:57,423 --> 00:06:00,073
But it is about tracks.

141
00:06:00,073 --> 00:06:01,412
And so, we can say,

142
00:06:01,412 --> 00:06:05,490
"Okay, we'll take the track is probably

143
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,784
"the most foundational
notion of this application."

144
00:06:09,784 --> 00:06:11,343
And then, we can take and say,

145
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:12,423
"Okay, now that we've decided

146
00:06:12,423 --> 00:06:15,723
"that tracks are the foundational notion,

147
00:06:15,723 --> 00:06:18,855
"which of these columns are simply

148
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:22,320
"an attribute of the track."

149
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,882
The cheapie, the cheating
way, the easy way

150
00:06:23,882 --> 00:06:26,189
in this particular one
is like these numbers.

151
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:29,301
All these numbers, like this
number and these numbers,

152
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,435
not that one (laughs) --

153
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:32,861
they just go along with track,

154
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:33,701
and so we'll put that in.

155
00:06:33,701 --> 00:06:36,530
We've got the track title,
rating, length, and count,

156
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,973
and we put that in.

157
00:06:39,973 --> 00:06:41,111
And then, the question is, we've got--

158
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:43,502
The remaining things are,
we've got the artist,

159
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:46,261
we've got the album,
and we've got the genre,

160
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:47,419
and so, we can say,

161
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:50,680
"Okay, we've got some
vertical duplication,"

162
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,513
so we're going to say,

163
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:54,570
"Okay, this track probably
belongs to an album,

164
00:06:54,570 --> 00:07:02,874
"so let's pull out the
album into its own table."

165
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:18,089
Pull the album out into its own table.

166
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,571
Pull the album out into its own table.

167
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:22,421
And, so, that pulls that
out, and then you say,

168
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:23,854
"Okay, what would be the next thing

169
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:24,931
"that we're going to pull out."

170
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:26,411
So, we've pulled out the track,

171
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:27,721
we've got this taken care of,

172
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:28,972
this taken care of, that taken--

173
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:30,932
Now, we've got the album.

174
00:07:30,932 --> 00:07:32,510
Well, albums belong to artists,

175
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,169
so let's take out the artist.

176
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:38,651
And then, we'll pick
where the genre belongs,

177
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:40,783
and we'll just say that the
genre belongs to the track,

178
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:42,602
because there might be albums

179
00:07:42,602 --> 00:07:44,582
with more than one different genre.

180
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:46,463
So, each album is not
necessarily a rock album,

181
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:50,219
it could have a rock track,
and a country track, etc.

182
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,010
Now, what we've got is,
we've got four tables, right?

183
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:55,024
We've got a track table,
we've got an album table,

184
00:07:55,024 --> 00:07:56,449
an artist table, and a genre table,

185
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,768
and if we double-check, all of the columns

186
00:07:58,768 --> 00:08:00,886
that had vertical duplication in them

187
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:04,737
now have their own little table.

188
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:07,328
So, we can eliminate,
the next thing we'll do

189
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,827
is to show how we're going to eliminate

190
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:14,835
this vertical data replication

191
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:16,888
by showing how you represent
these relationships

192
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:20,554
that we just created
inside of the database.
