1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:03,111
- Okay so now we're going
to write a web browser

2
00:00:03,111 --> 00:00:05,653
again in Python but it's going to even

3
00:00:05,653 --> 00:00:07,513
be shorter than what we did before.

4
00:00:07,513 --> 00:00:09,596
We did it in 10 lines using sockets.

5
00:00:09,596 --> 00:00:13,137
Now we're gonna do it in
four lines with urllib.

6
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:16,210
So urllib really is just because the idea

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,207
of opening a connection,
sending a get request,

8
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:20,618
sending the new line,
retrieving the stuff,

9
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:22,537
breaking the headers out,
doing all this stuff,

10
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:25,416
that's so common why
not put it in a library

11
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,316
to save ourselves some effort?

12
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:29,646
So here's how we do it.

13
00:00:29,646 --> 00:00:32,338
We're going to read it in, right,

14
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:34,554
we gonna import this
library so it's not part of,

15
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:36,105
we had to import sockets before,

16
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:38,007
but we're gonna import urllib now.

17
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:39,914
And so this is really quite simple,

18
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,361
it's like elegantly simple.

19
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:45,166
You say urllib, that's a library that's

20
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,164
a part of a module within the
library, and this is function.

21
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:52,756
So let's call URL open
and then give it the URL.

22
00:00:52,756 --> 00:00:53,589
Now that's a string, which it's gonna

23
00:00:53,589 --> 00:00:55,601
encode automatically for us.

24
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:57,949
So it's taking care of all
kind of pretty thing for us.

25
00:00:57,949 --> 00:00:59,576
It does the get it does the encode.

26
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:01,099
Look back at that previous code,

27
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:03,918
that's kinda what urllib
is doing for us, 'kay.

28
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:05,575
Now what urllib also does is it

29
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:09,289
makes the connection,
encodes the get request,

30
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:12,628
and then it actually
retrieves at this moment,

31
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:15,308
it retrieves all the headers
and keeps it for you for later.

32
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:17,246
You can get the headers but
we're not gonna see the headers

33
00:01:17,246 --> 00:01:19,813
and then it returns to you an object

34
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,122
that looks pretty much like a file handle.

35
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:26,104
Because you can put this in
the four clause after the end.

36
00:01:26,104 --> 00:01:31,123
Now it's going to read, run that loop

37
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:34,713
one time for every line of this file.

38
00:01:34,713 --> 00:01:36,988
And so the lines we're
gonna get back are bytes

39
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:38,672
and so we have to say
decode, it doesn't do that

40
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:41,816
for us automatically, we are
gonna have to decode them.

41
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:43,546
And that's because we
might need to decode them

42
00:01:43,546 --> 00:01:45,638
with a particular character set here.

43
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:47,156
And then we're gonna do our strip

44
00:01:47,156 --> 00:01:48,436
and we're gonna just print this out.

45
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:50,324
So that's just, that's like, open a file,

46
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:51,855
read through it, and print it.

47
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:53,283
This is open URL, read
through and print it.

48
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:56,943
And that's as simple as it is.

49
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:58,264
And so that's what happens,

50
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:01,676
this is romeo.txt and it prints out.

51
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:03,280
Now the thing to notice is that

52
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,296
there are no headers here,
the headers have been

53
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:07,501
sort of consumed in the URL open.

54
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:11,055
Again there is a way to say
"Hey, give me my headers."

55
00:02:11,055 --> 00:02:13,765
But for now, this just
gonna eat the headers

56
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:16,425
and keep them and then you
get to read all the data

57
00:02:16,425 --> 00:02:18,964
and the loop runs, and this loop runs

58
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,463
four times and out come the four lines.

59
00:02:20,463 --> 00:02:23,612
You can go ahead and run
this one, it's super easy.

60
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:26,026
I mean, literally, super easy.

61
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:30,201
You can do anything you want,
I mean treat it like a file.

62
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,707
You just have to remember
to do the decode bit

63
00:02:31,707 --> 00:02:34,456
when you treat it like a file, and so

64
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:37,140
that code imported, we're gonna open it

65
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,003
we're going to make a dictionary,

66
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:41,505
we're gonna loop through,
we're gonna split it.

67
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,482
We have to add the deep
code just to make sure

68
00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:45,482
because that line is bytes not string.

69
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:48,867
And then we're gonna go, our words.

70
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:51,242
We're gonna go through the line

71
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:53,627
and then each line we're gonna
bounce through the words.

72
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:55,467
The inner four loop is
bouncing through the words

73
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,161
and then we're gonna go to the next line

74
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,751
and then we make our cell loop.

75
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:01,882
And this, a dictionary, and
we print that dictionary out.

76
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:07,026
Now this, in effect,
other than importing this,

77
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:08,913
opening it differently
and doing the decode,

78
00:03:08,913 --> 00:03:11,882
this is exactly how we
would process a file.

79
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:14,495
And so by using urllib you really sort of

80
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,894
reduce the complexity of retrieving

81
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:18,818
and reading network resources

82
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:23,114
to the same complexity of
reading and dealing with a file

83
00:03:23,114 --> 00:03:26,527
locally on your hard drive,
which is kinda pretty.

84
00:03:26,527 --> 00:03:31,065
One of the things then we
can do is read web pages.

85
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:34,164
That was a text file, but you can HTML

86
00:03:34,164 --> 00:03:36,365
and so here's how you read a web page.

87
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:38,490
And it's the same kinda code.

88
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:44,042
We open a URL, this one
happens to have HTML on it

89
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:46,364
and we read through it
and out comes the HTML.

90
00:03:46,364 --> 00:03:48,158
Remember that the headers are there,

91
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,566
but they've been eaten by URL open for us.

92
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:52,868
And now we could write a browser

93
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:55,433
that would parse these
less-thans and greater-thans

94
00:03:55,433 --> 00:04:00,505
and make links, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

95
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:05,314
So if you can come up with
ways to find these links

96
00:04:05,314 --> 00:04:07,302
you could actually write bit of code

97
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:09,345
that would then have a loop that

98
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:10,643
would go up and open a new one,

99
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:11,721
pull out the links, open a new one,

100
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:13,724
pull out the links, open a new one.

101
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:15,136
And so you could, you could make a thing

102
00:04:15,136 --> 00:04:16,998
that would retrieve,
you could write program

103
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:20,176
that would retrieve a page,
find the links in the page

104
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,024
and then retrieve those links.

105
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:25,777
And we'll actually do that
before the end of the class.

106
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:27,882
And so Python is a very
popular language at Google

107
00:04:27,882 --> 00:04:31,890
and I wonder if, I think
it's a pretty safe bet

108
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,382
that the first crawler that they wrote

109
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:37,564
to crawl the web to build
the index was Python.

110
00:04:37,564 --> 00:04:41,064
Because literally that's all
it takes to read web pages

111
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:45,901
and pull those web pages into
your web crawler database.

112
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:47,957
So, I don't know, are
those the first four lines

113
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:51,576
ever written at Google, who knows?

114
00:04:51,576 --> 00:04:53,102
So the next thing that we'll talk about

115
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:56,006
is how you handle that HTML.

116
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:59,474
HTML's kind of yucky and nasty and so

117
00:04:59,474 --> 00:05:01,279
it's not as simple as regular expressions.

118
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,518
Regular expressions might
help string parsing and split

119
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:07,025
might help but it's just too crazy.

120
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:08,851
So we'll talk a little bit
about how to use a library

121
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:13,670
to make HTML parsing a lot easier.

122
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,670
(smooth jazz music)
