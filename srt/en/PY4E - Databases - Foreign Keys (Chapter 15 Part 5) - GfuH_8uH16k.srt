1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:01,749
- So now that we know what a primary key,

2
00:00:01,749 --> 00:00:03,468
logical key, and a foreign key are,

3
00:00:03,468 --> 00:00:04,991
we're going to actually start putting

4
00:00:04,991 --> 00:00:06,750
these together and creating tables

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,885
that have these kinds of values in them.

6
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,677
So, when we were done,
we drew this picture

7
00:00:11,677 --> 00:00:13,101
that was sort of a logical model

8
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:15,533
of how our data would be spread across

9
00:00:15,533 --> 00:00:18,308
four tables and how those
tables are connected.

10
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:20,200
Now we have to take this
and we have to map it

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,172
in a way that leads to the columns

12
00:00:23,172 --> 00:00:25,402
and the needed columns in each

13
00:00:25,402 --> 00:00:27,142
of our database tables.

14
00:00:27,142 --> 00:00:28,809
So here's what we do.

15
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:32,378
We basically have to take,
and for each of these,

16
00:00:32,378 --> 00:00:35,042
when we're gonna build a track table,

17
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:36,602
and we're gonna build a track table,

18
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:38,140
we add a primary key.

19
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,094
So we just added an id field
to every one of these things,

20
00:00:41,094 --> 00:00:42,854
and that's so we have a place to store

21
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:46,079
the sequence number of
this particular row.

22
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,745
We have logical keys,
we've just marked those.

23
00:00:47,745 --> 00:00:49,832
Those are strings, and
then we have things like

24
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,335
rating, length, and count, they just kinda

25
00:00:51,335 --> 00:00:55,946
go in here, and now we have
to model a relationship.

26
00:00:55,946 --> 00:01:00,027
In the table, the
relationship starts from,

27
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,547
we put one more column
in, and this is the one

28
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:04,700
I will name "album id" and that just is

29
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,639
an integer column that's going to record

30
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:10,320
the album id, so this might be 16,

31
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,020
and then 16 goes in here.

32
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,001
So there's one of these columns

33
00:01:13,001 --> 00:01:15,671
that's a foreign key that points to this.

34
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:16,908
And that's why it's foreign,

35
00:01:16,908 --> 00:01:18,737
this is a key that's
not in the track table.

36
00:01:18,737 --> 00:01:20,996
This is a key in the album table

37
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:24,386
that we're pointing to, so
there's the foreign key.

38
00:01:24,386 --> 00:01:25,653
That's what we have to do, and we just

39
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:28,011
do that over and over and over again

40
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:30,871
and we quickly convert that picture

41
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,695
that was a logical picture,

42
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:35,843
to having every table has a primary key,

43
00:01:35,843 --> 00:01:37,954
and every time we have a starting point,

44
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:39,813
we have a foreign key, foreign key,

45
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:40,951
and then foreign key.

46
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,669
And then we mark these
things as logical key,

47
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:45,472
logical key, logical key,
and we'll see how we do that.

48
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,890
And so that's the picture.

49
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,135
Now we have a picture of exactly how

50
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:50,672
we're gonna lay these tables out,

51
00:01:50,672 --> 00:01:53,385
and the fields that we
need in these tables.

52
00:01:53,385 --> 00:02:02,686
So, we're going to do a
create table statement.

53
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:09,658
And I've got this create
table statement sitting there.

54
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:12,659
And so this one's going to
be a little bit different.

55
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:15,279
We're gonna say create table "artist"

56
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:19,144
and the id field is integer,

57
00:02:19,144 --> 00:02:21,966
and we're gonna add all of this stuff.

58
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:26,424
This is adding to the column
to tell it additional stuff.

59
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:27,678
It's a primary key, which means we're

60
00:02:27,678 --> 00:02:29,606
gonna use it to look up a lot.

61
00:02:29,606 --> 00:02:31,046
It's automatically
incremented, which means

62
00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:32,236
the database is actually gonna provide

63
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,460
this number for us as we insert records.

64
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,652
It's not allowed to be null,

65
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:38,179
it's not allowed to be empty,

66
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:39,899
and it's supposed to be unique.

67
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:45,109
And then the artist is
gonna have a name column,

68
00:02:45,109 --> 00:02:47,083
a name column that's just text.

69
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,808
So let's do that.

70
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:52,086
We already have our users.

71
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:55,053
Now we're gonna do a
create table in this SQL,

72
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:57,507
and you can do that, that's
okay, that's totally fine.

73
00:02:57,507 --> 00:03:00,515
And we have to get this
right, and we say away we go.

74
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:03,701
And so now if I take a
look at database structure,

75
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,187
I've got a users table, that users table

76
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:10,049
we were playing with before,
and this artist table.

77
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,854
Let me go ahead and
delete this users table

78
00:03:12,854 --> 00:03:15,159
just to say goodbye.

79
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:16,244
So now we have the artist table,

80
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:18,067
and we take a look and it's got an id,

81
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:22,602
and it knows all about this stuff, 'kay?

82
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,288
So, that created the table.

83
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,012
We're going to keep doing this.

84
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:28,620
The next thing that
we're going to show here

85
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,753
is we're going to show
the foreign key, right,

86
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,127
so artist id is just an integer.

87
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:37,067
In some database languages,
like MySQL and Oracle,

88
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:37,900
you would put more stuff here to say

89
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,740
this is a foreign key, blah blah blah,

90
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,515
but in SQLite, we keep it simple

91
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:43,558
and just say that is an integer column,

92
00:03:43,558 --> 00:03:45,769
that's a foreign key, the album table

93
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:47,847
has a primary key and a foreign key,

94
00:03:47,847 --> 00:03:55,207
and then the title.

95
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:57,841
So we'll go back and we'll grab that text

96
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:02,671
out of my little page, this create table.

97
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:11,259
Go back to Execute SQL, and then run that.

98
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:17,829
And we'll continue, the
genre table has an id on it.

99
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,099
Just copy and paste
these, that whole thing,

100
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,795
you do that over and over and over again,

101
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:26,108
so we'll go in here and run that one.

102
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:32,325
And so the last one we're going to do

103
00:04:32,325 --> 00:04:33,985
is the track table, and the only thing

104
00:04:33,985 --> 00:04:35,557
that's kinda weird about the track table

105
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:37,474
is it's got two foreign keys, right.

106
00:04:37,474 --> 00:04:39,471
It's got album id and genre id.

107
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,638
Once you draw the
picture, you just sort of

108
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:42,878
literally translate these things.

109
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:44,857
It's got two foreign
keys and a primary key

110
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:51,342
that's pretty much just like
all those other primary keys.

111
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:54,231
Integer counts and integer lengths and

112
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:57,215
integer all that stuff,
and now we've got it.

113
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,627
We take a look at our database structure,

114
00:04:58,627 --> 00:05:01,550
we're gonna see that our
album, genre, and track

115
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,216
are all set up, and these are new columns

116
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:12,211
that we just made with those
create statements, kay?

117
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,945
So now let's insert some data.

118
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:15,535
This first insert statement is

119
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:17,720
kind of important to take a look at.

120
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,657
So insert into, by the way the keywords

121
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:22,810
can be upper or lower
case, table name, columns.

122
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,025
Now, this table has two
columns, it has id and name,

123
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,088
but we told the database that id

124
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:30,471
was auto-increment, so it's gonna actually

125
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:33,678
give us the number, it's
gonna assign the number

126
00:05:33,678 --> 00:05:34,897
rather than make us assign.

127
00:05:34,897 --> 00:05:36,447
We could make it be one two three,

128
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:37,501
but we say, "Hey, database, you're good

129
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:40,318
"at this, why don't you
make it one two three?"

130
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:41,960
And so there is going to be a record

131
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:50,272
that it adds Led Zeppelin,
so let's take a look at that.

132
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:56,918
We'll insert Led Zeppelin, oops,

133
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,568
over to SQL, insert Led
Zeppelin and run it.

134
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:04,047
So now if I look at database structure,

135
00:06:04,047 --> 00:06:06,711
let's look at browse data, and look

136
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:08,429
at the artist database, you will see

137
00:06:08,429 --> 00:06:11,186
that I put Led Zeppelin
in, but this id field

138
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:13,821
here was auto-incremented, and so

139
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,533
it was put there by the database.

140
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,600
Now when we do the next insert,

141
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:26,478
which is AC/DC,

142
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,059
and we take a look at the data,

143
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:32,497
we'll see that AC/DC is 2.

144
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:35,173
Now, if you're writing this in a program,

145
00:06:35,173 --> 00:06:37,641
if you're gonna write this in a program,

146
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:38,659
you can get these numbers back

147
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,949
from the database in your program,

148
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,076
but I'm not writing this in a program

149
00:06:42,076 --> 00:06:45,007
so I have to remember that 1 is Zeppelin

150
00:06:45,007 --> 00:06:47,297
and 2 is AC/DC.

151
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:48,862
I'm gonna keep myself a
little cheat sheet here

152
00:06:48,862 --> 00:06:52,273
to remember that, because everywhere else

153
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:53,929
in the program that we
wanna say Led Zeppelin,

154
00:06:53,929 --> 00:06:57,145
I gotta say 1 now, because the artist id

155
00:06:57,145 --> 00:07:00,364
of 1 means Led Zeppelin in those rows.

156
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:02,194
Now we're going to go back and we're

157
00:07:02,194 --> 00:07:04,954
gonna take a look at the next one.

158
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:07,354
Now we're gonna put the genre in.

159
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:08,488
If you think about it, we're working

160
00:07:08,488 --> 00:07:10,722
from the leaves out, the track will

161
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,308
be the last table that we'll update

162
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:13,985
because we'll have to define the keys

163
00:07:13,985 --> 00:07:15,268
for things like rock and metal

164
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,962
and Led Zeppelin and
all those other things.

165
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:19,814
And again, even though the genre table

166
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,153
has two columns, id and name,

167
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:23,272
we're only gonna specify the name

168
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:28,909
and let the database assign the value.

169
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,350
So I'm gonna insert both of these

170
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,111
and use the semicolon trick.

171
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:39,080
Put a semicolon here
and a semicolon there,

172
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,445
and run that.

173
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,873
So if I take a look at my browse data

174
00:07:43,873 --> 00:07:46,038
and I look at the genre, it's assigned

175
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:48,408
1 to rock and 2 to metal.

176
00:07:48,408 --> 00:07:50,398
I'm gonna write that down.

177
00:07:50,398 --> 00:07:54,837
1 rock, 2 metal.

178
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:56,145
I shoulda done something
like rock and country

179
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:57,243
'cause I can't even tell the difference

180
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,849
between rock and metal, but whatever.

181
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:04,794
My musical skill is not
what's at issue in this class.

182
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:08,202
So now, we're going to put an album in.

183
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:10,337
The album is the first thing
that has a foreign key,

184
00:08:10,337 --> 00:08:13,995
so if you remember,
album points to artist,

185
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:16,968
and so that means it has a
foreign key of artist id.

186
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:18,878
We have to explicitly say this

187
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:21,478
'cause the system doesn't know

188
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:23,406
which artist Who Made Who is,

189
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:27,417
but we know that Who Made
Who is AC/DC and that's 2,

190
00:08:27,417 --> 00:08:29,627
and so we know to put artist id in,

191
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:32,431
so we'll say insert into
album, title, artist id,

192
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:35,080
and so we have to know
what this 2 number is.

193
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,566
And of course, because we have our

194
00:08:36,566 --> 00:08:42,666
handy little cheat sheet.

195
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,929
We can go over to execute and run that,

196
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:47,350
and I'll put a semicolon there and

197
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,979
a semicolon there and run it.

198
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:56,584
So now we have,

199
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:58,428
in the album field,

200
00:08:58,428 --> 00:09:01,504
we now have this, and
so this was assigned,

201
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:02,898
and so Who Made Who-

202
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:06,207
Still have to write down that

203
00:09:06,207 --> 00:09:10,338
Who Made Who is album 1,

204
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:13,602
and album 2 is Led Zeppelin IV.

205
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:14,745
That makes it even more complex

206
00:09:14,745 --> 00:09:17,681
'cause the name of the album
is a Roman numeral four.

207
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:19,453
I'm sure I can figure that out.

208
00:09:19,453 --> 00:09:22,574
Okay, so, the next thing that we're

209
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:25,663
going to do is we're gonna
insert the track record.

210
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:27,302
Now if you think about the track record,

211
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:32,246
the track has two foreign keys

212
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:33,229
and it's got a lot of stuff.

213
00:09:33,229 --> 00:09:34,288
It's got the title, it's got the rating,

214
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:35,600
length, count, but then we've got

215
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,813
the two foreign keys, and so we

216
00:09:36,813 --> 00:09:41,299
have to know these numbers, so this 2, 1,

217
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:45,409
this 2, 1, this 1, 2 is the genre.

218
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:46,989
We're specifying the genre and the album

219
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:50,867
that this track is from by those numbers.

220
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:53,485
Now, again, we have to
use this cheat sheet,

221
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:54,882
but if this was a program, the program

222
00:09:54,882 --> 00:09:59,887
would know that 1 was Zeppelin,

223
00:09:59,887 --> 00:10:02,622
and 1 was Who Made Who
and 2 was Led Zeppelin IV.

224
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:04,374
And so the programs, this kind of stuff

225
00:10:04,374 --> 00:10:07,578
is easier for the program to understand

226
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:09,638
than for us to keep
track of and understand,

227
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:12,831
but just so we can get
through these few records,

228
00:10:12,831 --> 00:10:16,093
and that's why I rely so
heavily on my cheat sheet.

229
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:19,009
So here we are, with all these numbers,

230
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:21,540
the foreign keys are the tricky part here,

231
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,798
everything else is really
quite straightforward.

232
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:33,921
So now I'm gonna insert four
records into my track table.

233
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:37,126
And then run that.

234
00:10:37,126 --> 00:10:41,526
Okay, so I go to browse data
and I look at my track table.

235
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:43,489
This column here, this id, that's

236
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:44,934
the primary key to the track table,

237
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:46,908
then here are the two foreign keys.

238
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:48,705
Now the interesting thing is now

239
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:51,741
there is replication in these columns,

240
00:10:51,741 --> 00:10:53,723
but the numbers are
what's being replicated,

241
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,099
and that's okay.

242
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:57,891
We (laughs) went a long time just

243
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,729
not to put Led Zeppelin IV in twice.

244
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,295
We could have made this a string,

245
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,644
but by making this an integer,

246
00:11:03,644 --> 00:11:06,324
it saves tons of storage
and makes it super fast.

247
00:11:06,324 --> 00:11:09,217
That turns out to be one of the key things

248
00:11:09,217 --> 00:11:11,382
that makes databases super fast

249
00:11:11,382 --> 00:11:15,347
is using these integers.

250
00:11:15,347 --> 00:11:16,549
So we take a look at all this stuff.

251
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,073
We see that in a sense, by using

252
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:21,190
these little numbers, we are pointing

253
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,926
to rows in other tables.

254
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:24,528
The foreign keys are always pointing,

255
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:26,208
they always point to their id.

256
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,758
So these foreign keys are out here,

257
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:29,499
this is the primary key up here,

258
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:31,602
and they always point
to a row in the table.
