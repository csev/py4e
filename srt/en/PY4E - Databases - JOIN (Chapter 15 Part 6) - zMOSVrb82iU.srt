1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,201
- So now that we've carefully

2
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:03,911
constructed our
relationships in the tables

3
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:07,729
we need to reconstruct the
data to show our users.

4
00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:10,169
You can kind of see how you would

5
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:11,195
go pull this stuff together,

6
00:00:11,195 --> 00:00:12,497
but there's the wonderful capability

7
00:00:12,497 --> 00:00:14,615
in relational databases called "join"

8
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,851
that brings this all back together.

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,746
We have done this for
efficiency of storage,

10
00:00:20,746 --> 00:00:23,097
efficiency of scanning, etc.

11
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:27,763
But we do need to reverse
these foreign keys at times.

12
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:31,720
The database software will
do this for us automatically.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,428
The join operation basically
is a way to specify

14
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:36,966
in a select statement
that you want to pull data

15
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,556
out of more than one tables.

16
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:40,220
And then specifying using what's called

17
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:45,606
the "on" clause exactly how
you want that data pulled out.

18
00:00:45,606 --> 00:00:47,599
So here we go.

19
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:50,606
We already have a table.

20
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:54,338
An album table to the artist
table and the foreign key.

21
00:00:54,338 --> 00:00:56,538
We want to in effect pull data

22
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:58,410
from both the album and the artist.

23
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,729
The album title and the artist name.

24
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:02,235
We want to show that.

25
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:04,310
So we are going to say "Select",

26
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,526
which is the same select statement.

27
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:07,547
Here's a little different syntax.

28
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:08,972
This is the list of fields.

29
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:11,164
This is table, dot, fields.

30
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:13,845
So it's the album title
and the artist, dot, name.

31
00:01:13,845 --> 00:01:15,026
Comma there.

32
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:17,771
From the album...

33
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:20,119
I always start with where
the little arrow starts from.

34
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,155
Album joined with.

35
00:01:22,155 --> 00:01:25,123
So that is going to walk
down this connection

36
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:27,145
from album to artist.

37
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:29,418
Album joined with artist.

38
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:31,292
Don't say "with", I just say it.

39
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:34,146
"On", and then this is
the conditions upon which

40
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:35,976
that join is going to happen.

41
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:41,208
When the album's artist_id,
which is this column here,

42
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:45,151
matches, this of that as
"is equal to" or matches,

43
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:46,537
the artist_id.

44
00:01:46,537 --> 00:01:48,689
So it only connects the rows here

45
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,783
when there is a match
between these two tables.

46
00:01:51,783 --> 00:01:55,645
If we look at this and we see that

47
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:58,611
this one matches this one and
this one matches that one.

48
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,399
So it's the "join" connects conditionally

49
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,258
and it connects when the
"on" clause is satisfied.

50
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:09,769
When this whole join
runs this is what we get.

51
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:11,439
You select all this stuff.

52
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,663
Now this is an abstraction.

53
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:13,884
Are you writing a loop,

54
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,594
are you doing two nested loops?

55
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,047
How exactly are you bringing
all this data together?

56
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:19,147
We don't care about that.

57
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:21,068
That's the beauty of SQL.

58
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:24,526
That's the beauty of how
we do this in a database.

59
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:26,981
Now if we can just run this command.

60
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:29,138
So let's grab this command.

61
00:02:29,138 --> 00:02:32,253
"Select track title, genre name
from "track", join "genre",

62
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:34,088
that exact query.

63
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:36,695
Case of keywords doesn't matter.

64
00:02:36,695 --> 00:02:39,593
We go over here and we run this as SQL.

65
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:43,100
We run it, we get...

66
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:49,623
Oops, I got too far.

67
00:02:49,623 --> 00:02:50,602
Let's do this one.

68
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:51,783
Let's do that one there.

69
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:55,081
Select artist name.

70
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:57,195
I have to add that one
to my little cheat sheet.

71
00:02:57,195 --> 00:03:00,865
The next time you see the
cheat sheet it'll be right.

72
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:02,375
The title.

73
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,837
This is coming from one table

74
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:08,483
and that's coming from another table.

75
00:03:08,483 --> 00:03:10,441
So that's one.

76
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:12,276
Here is something we can do

77
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,369
that gives us a little
more detail on that.

78
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:19,689
We can say, "So this is
where the connection is."

79
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:22,536
You can think of the join as
sort of spreading one table

80
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,021
and connecting it to the other table.

81
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:28,116
So what we're going to show
here is, it's exactly the same.

82
00:03:28,116 --> 00:03:29,697
Only thing we're going to do is

83
00:03:29,697 --> 00:03:30,851
we're going to add these two columns

84
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:34,344
so you can see where the match happens.

85
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:36,003
This is one table.

86
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:37,551
This is another table.

87
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,300
These are the columns in
common, even though they're not.

88
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,931
They're the columns that match.

89
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,661
This is where the "on"
clause is happening.

90
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:52,255
We have taken this table,

91
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:54,833
joined with this table

92
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,948
on these two things
connecting with each other.

93
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,531
You can almost in some language,

94
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,667
in some variants of SQL,

95
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,581
this would even be "where" clause.

96
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:05,024
You connect these two rows,

97
00:04:05,024 --> 00:04:10,150
but only connect them when
those two numbers match.

98
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,071
You can see if we run this.

99
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:19,041
I'll just run this.

100
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,868
Again, you just see this
is where it connects.

101
00:04:22,868 --> 00:04:28,811
Now, interestingly, we
can see what happens

102
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:31,681
and what the purpose of the "on" clause is

103
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:33,227
if we omit it.

104
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:36,283
So this is exactly the
same as that previous query

105
00:04:36,283 --> 00:04:38,246
except there's no "on" clause.

106
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:40,406
It's select all four of those fields

107
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:42,531
from the track, join with the genre.

108
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:45,403
So it's basically taking the track table

109
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:48,592
and the genre with a
join, but no "on" clause.

110
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:51,367
So it's not filtering for matches.

111
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,972
This is a match. This is a match.

112
00:04:53,972 --> 00:04:55,881
That's a match. That's a match.

113
00:04:55,881 --> 00:04:57,589
But we don't have an "on" clause

114
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:00,047
so the matchingness doesn't matter.

115
00:05:00,047 --> 00:05:02,252
So you're gonna get all
possible combinations

116
00:05:02,252 --> 00:05:06,120
and literally if there we 10 on one side

117
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,698
and 30 on the other side
you would get 300 rows

118
00:05:09,698 --> 00:05:10,960
in that join.

119
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,710
So it would be all combinations
except the "on clause

120
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:15,100
reduces the combinations.

121
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,390
You might think, "Whoa,
this is really inefficient."

122
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,711
I will say that's what
my first reaction was

123
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:20,893
when I first saw this,

124
00:05:20,893 --> 00:05:22,848
but it's not inefficient.

125
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,355
That's the beauty of abstraction.

126
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:25,528
That's the beauty of SQL.

127
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:26,545
You say, "Do it!"

128
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:31,994
and it just figures that out.

129
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:33,308
Let me grab this and you will see

130
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,937
that we can run this one as well.

131
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:38,761
That kind of gives you why
the "on" clause is important.

132
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,839
Because now we have a whole
bunch of these things.

133
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:43,303
The "on" clause just filters that out.

134
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:46,459
So if we just add the "on" clause back in

135
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:48,132
then that would only show the ones

136
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:50,165
we showed on the previous slide.

137
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:51,849
So that's why the "on"
clause is important.

138
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,970
The join is like all possible combinations

139
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,268
of all pairs of rows
between these two tables.

140
00:05:57,268 --> 00:06:00,307
"On" is only where these two things match.

141
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:02,102
You might think that it's inefficient,

142
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:04,298
but the "on" clause turns out to be

143
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:10,506
the way it becomes efficient.

144
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:22,512
Okay.

145
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:24,879
So now we're going to do the same thing

146
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,140
where we're just going to take

147
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,281
the track title and the genre

148
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:29,196
and gonna connect that together.

149
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:30,781
We select this.

150
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:32,737
We need to join from one table.

151
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:34,820
Join to the genre table
with an "on" clause.

152
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,178
We're gonna make those connections.

153
00:06:37,178 --> 00:06:38,478
The only thing we're gonna look at

154
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:47,391
is the title and the genre name.

155
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,706
Oops.

156
00:06:49,706 --> 00:06:52,025
And then run that.

157
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,934
So we got the title and genre name.

158
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:57,797
The thing you'll notice
is for the first time

159
00:06:57,797 --> 00:07:00,477
we now have replication of string data

160
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:01,982
in the vertical dimension.

161
00:07:01,982 --> 00:07:03,483
That's okay.

162
00:07:03,483 --> 00:07:06,128
Because the data is not
replicated in the database.

163
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:09,058
The data is now replicated
as a result of the join.

164
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:12,842
So we are going to reconstruct
what the user wants to see,

165
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:14,023
which the user originally,

166
00:07:14,023 --> 00:07:15,451
all the way back at the beginning,

167
00:07:15,451 --> 00:07:16,916
wanted to see the duplicated information

168
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:18,662
in the vertical axis.

169
00:07:18,662 --> 00:07:20,691
But now we're reconstructing it.

170
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:23,824
We didn't waste the space or
performance in our database,

171
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:25,938
but we still have to show them.

172
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:31,363
So now the next thing we're
gonna do is a monster.

173
00:07:31,363 --> 00:07:34,350
We're gonna reconstruct
across all four tables.

174
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,934
You might think, "This is really hard."

175
00:07:35,934 --> 00:07:38,123
And sure, it's gonna be a little tricky,

176
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:41,020
but as long as you follow
the naming convention

177
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,810
and the naming convention makes sense.

178
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,595
We're gonna do a select from

179
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:45,815
the track's title, the artist's,

180
00:07:45,815 --> 00:07:48,258
the album's title, and the genre name.

181
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:51,993
From the track join genre, join the album,

182
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:53,339
join the artist.

183
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,610
The joins follow the little arrows.

184
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,747
And then the "on" clause
qualifies each of those arrows,

185
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,373
when to follow the arrow.

186
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:04,484
Then this becomes pretty easy.

187
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,533
It's a foreign key that tracks genre ID.

188
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,250
That's a foreign key.

189
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,408
Equals Genre.id.

190
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:13,380
That's primary key, that's a foreign key

191
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,807
because I name it that way

192
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:16,882
and I know this goes to that genre table

193
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:18,795
because I name it that way.

194
00:08:18,795 --> 00:08:22,535
And track's album ID is
equal to the album's ID.

195
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,482
Foreign key, primary key.

196
00:08:24,482 --> 00:08:29,032
And album's artist ID
is equal to artist's ID.

197
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:30,782
After a while you can
type these pretty fast

198
00:08:30,782 --> 00:08:32,572
as long as you follow a naming convention

199
00:08:32,572 --> 00:08:34,711
and you know the naming convention.

200
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:36,905
So this looks like it's hard to do,

201
00:08:36,905 --> 00:08:40,351
but after a while it's
really just a pattern.

202
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:45,852
So let's go ahead and run that one.

203
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:49,595
It will, assuming we've
done everything right,

204
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,813
replicate all the data.

205
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:53,455
So, there's all kinds of vertical
data now being replicated.

206
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:55,369
Every column has vertical data.

207
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,323
Again, it's not in the database.

208
00:08:57,323 --> 00:09:01,109
The select and the join are
reconstructing vertical data

209
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:04,921
as it needs to be shown to the user.

210
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:08,237
And so if you've been following along,

211
00:09:08,237 --> 00:09:11,185
(laughs) probably a
couple hours later now.

212
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:12,661
We started with a picture
that was a mock up

213
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:14,453
of what we wanted our user
interface to look like

214
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,673
and it had vertical stuff.

215
00:09:15,673 --> 00:09:18,847
We're like, "Ah, we can't put
that in a database model!"

216
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,169
And then we carefully
built a database model

217
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,389
that didn't have the data.

218
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:24,308
And then we're like, "Ah,
we gotta reconstruct it!"

219
00:09:24,308 --> 00:09:26,908
So we used join to reconstruct it.

220
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:28,891
After all that we went here

221
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:30,885
with a clean little
model with four tables,

222
00:09:30,885 --> 00:09:32,634
all beautifully connected together

223
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:35,352
and then we had to join
it all back together.

224
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:36,898
Join reconstructs it.

225
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:40,194
Again, the key is the
storage is efficient,

226
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:43,612
the scanning is efficient,
and we still use the join

227
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:46,538
to produce the output
that we ultimately want

228
00:09:46,538 --> 00:09:51,543
with all the vertical
replication that our users

229
00:09:51,543 --> 00:09:54,796
really want to see.

230
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:56,545
One more kind of relationship.

231
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:58,742
That was called a
one-to-many relationship.

232
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:01,113
That was actually three
one-to-many relationships.

233
00:10:01,113 --> 00:10:03,183
The other major relationship
is what's called

234
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:07,991
a many-to-many relationship.

235
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:10,991
