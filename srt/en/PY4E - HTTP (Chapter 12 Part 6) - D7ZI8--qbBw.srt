1
00:00:00,413 --> 00:00:02,528
- So now we're going to
talk about what you would do

2
00:00:02,528 --> 00:00:04,322
with a web page once you've retrieved it

3
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:05,801
in a Python program.

4
00:00:05,801 --> 00:00:08,328
Call this web scraping.

5
00:00:08,328 --> 00:00:10,259
And so web scraping or web spidering

6
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:12,012
is the act of retrieving a web page,

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,668
extracting the links from those web page,

8
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:15,847
making a queue of un-retrieved links,

9
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:16,846
and then moving on.

10
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:19,092
And eventually the idea
is, if you had enough time,

11
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:20,921
energy, bandwidth, and storage,

12
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,522
you could find your way
to most of the web pages

13
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:25,565
on the Internet that
are pointing, that point

14
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:30,038
point to or are pointed
to by other web pages.

15
00:00:30,038 --> 00:00:32,192
And so, you might have
all kinds of reasons

16
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:33,093
to scrape data.

17
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:35,508
You might have a blog that you posted.

18
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,726
You might have, who knows?

19
00:00:37,726 --> 00:00:39,729
Maybe you put some data in a system.

20
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:42,379
Maybe, maybe the system's being shut down

21
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:44,779
because it's being retired.

22
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,356
You can do all kinds of things.

23
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:47,554
You can write a little thing.

24
00:00:47,554 --> 00:00:49,261
I was talking to somebody who wrote

25
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:51,358
a thing to retrieve something and check

26
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:53,643
and then send a text
when something changed.

27
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:54,692
All kinds of stuff.

28
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:57,126
Or you might make
yourself a search engine.

29
00:00:57,126 --> 00:00:58,972
But be careful.

30
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:02,989
Not all websites are happy
about you using a robot

31
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:04,644
to retrieve their content.

32
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:06,228
Some of the websites as we'll see

33
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:08,591
demand that you log in
and they track what you do

34
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:10,245
and if they think you're
doing something bad,

35
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:12,007
they will shut your account off.

36
00:01:12,007 --> 00:01:14,489
Other websites will
track what you're doing

37
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,016
without you logging in but
then shut your address off.

38
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:19,938
And so you have to be careful.

39
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:20,838
You should read up.

40
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:23,968
You should figure out what
sites allow you to scrape them.

41
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,507
Now I have some sites that I've set up

42
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:26,694
that you can play with

43
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:30,369
to make it so that it's legit.

44
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:33,854
So, parsing HTML is difficult.

45
00:01:33,854 --> 00:01:36,245
Some of the simple examples, you know,

46
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:38,255
you can probably write
a regular expression

47
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:41,689
or you know, certainly some
splitting and some whatever,

48
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:44,605
and what you would find is
you would write that code

49
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,741
and you'd retrieve your
first five web pages

50
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:48,301
and it would seem to work,
and then it would encounter

51
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:52,079
some really weird but legitimate HTML.

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,508
Or maybe even sort of
slightly broken HTML.

53
00:01:54,508 --> 00:01:56,941
So the Web is full of broken HTML,

54
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:58,489
and your browsers just look at it and go,

55
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,207
"Oh, wow, more broken HTML."

56
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:01,943
But they don't put up error messages,

57
00:02:01,943 --> 00:02:05,068
and so people just leave broken pages up.

58
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:07,801
But your Python proram's
gonna see those broken pages.

59
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:08,984
So what you would do
is, you would be like,

60
00:02:08,984 --> 00:02:12,310
"Oh, here's a new weird
way to do an anchor tag.

61
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,943
"I'll change my code."

62
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:16,247
And then run for another
hundred pages and like,

63
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:18,940
"Oh no, here's a new weird
way to do an anchor tag."

64
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,140
And the problem is is
that you're gonna find

65
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,834
a lot of different ways
to mess up an anchor tag.

66
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:25,640
And someone's already done that.

67
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,093
There's a software called Beautiful Soup.

68
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:30,909
And we have installation
instructions on how to use it.

69
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:33,949
And really what it is is
it's, somebody just spent

70
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:37,115
months figuring out all the
nasty things that could happen

71
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,247
and compensated for it

72
00:02:38,247 --> 00:02:42,026
and gave you a nice, wrapped
interface that just says,

73
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:43,385
"Look, you give me the HTML

74
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:45,763
"and I'll give you back the tags. Okay?"

75
00:02:45,763 --> 00:02:48,108
And so it's called Beautiful Soup.

76
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:49,983
And so you have to install this.

77
00:02:49,983 --> 00:02:52,783
There's a couple of ways
that you can install this.

78
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:54,704
If you're good at extending your Python,

79
00:02:54,704 --> 00:02:58,342
you can just, you know, extend
and install Beautiful Soup

80
00:02:58,342 --> 00:02:59,933
for all Python programs.

81
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:04,010
If you can't change your
computer's configuration

82
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,341
because you're on a school computer

83
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:09,437
or you're using a USB stick or something,

84
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:12,352
then there's a way to download
this file that I've created

85
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:14,446
called BS4.zip and so what you do

86
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:19,851
is you end up with your
file called URLlinks.py

87
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:22,188
and then a little folder called BS4,

88
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:24,676
which is a folder that
has a bunch of files in it

89
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,137
from the zip file.

90
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:29,325
And then you can run it,
and so it'll pull it in

91
00:03:29,325 --> 00:03:32,272
and you'll import from
BS4, Beautiful Soup,

92
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:34,892
and that's either gonna pull
it in from the folder you do

93
00:03:34,892 --> 00:03:39,301
or if you have installed it
using the Python installer,

94
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:42,702
it will also just, you don't
have to put this file in.

95
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:43,641
So it's up to you.

96
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,376
You can either do it one of two ways.

97
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:48,316
So this is a little bit of code.

98
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:50,818
Now, Beautiful Soup is a complex library

99
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:52,923
and so just because this looks easy,

100
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:54,846
doing things in Beautiful Soup,

101
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,872
you might have to actually read a bit more

102
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,068
to figure it out.

103
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:00,274
But we're going to just read this.

104
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:04,528
We're going to

105
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:05,760
import Beautiful Soup,

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,250
we're gonna ask for a URL right here.

107
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,648
We're going to take that
URL, we're gonna open it.

108
00:04:10,648 --> 00:04:14,233
URL open, give the URL
and read the whole thing.

109
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,400
That means we're not writing a loop.

110
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,399
We've read the whole thing.

111
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,781
That's okay as long as you know

112
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:20,416
that the file's not so large.

113
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:23,720
And then we're going to
pass the data we got back

114
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,817
and this is gonna be bytes,

115
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:26,420
but Beautiful Soup knows all about bytes

116
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,894
and all about UTF8

117
00:04:27,894 --> 00:04:29,781
and it figures that out, and you just say,

118
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:32,265
"Hey, take that stuff I just got

119
00:04:32,265 --> 00:04:34,393
"and tear it apart using HTML.

120
00:04:34,393 --> 00:04:37,484
"And give me back an
object, a Soup object."

121
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,138
Now, the Soup object is something

122
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:40,729
that you can run queries against.

123
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,491
So it parses it, it deals
with all the imperfections

124
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:49,100
and inconsistencies in
this HTML byte array.

125
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,471
And it fixes that.

126
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:51,304
It gives that back.

127
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:52,491
And so there's various things you can do,

128
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:54,570
and you got to go look at the
Beautiful Soup documentation.

129
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,426
It could be a whole
class on Beautiful Soup.

130
00:04:57,426 --> 00:05:00,961
So here's a thing you
can do is this object,

131
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:03,207
you can sort of call it like a function

132
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:05,947
and say, "Hey, give me
back the anchor tags."

133
00:05:05,947 --> 00:05:07,536
And anchor tags, of course, are the tags

134
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:13,100
that say href equals
blah, blah, blah slash-a.

135
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,619
So all of this is an anchor tag.

136
00:05:15,619 --> 00:05:17,260
And then we're gonna
loop through the tags,

137
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,416
because there could be more
than one of those anchor tags

138
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:20,638
in the file.

139
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:22,498
And then we're going
to pull out that href,

140
00:05:22,498 --> 00:05:23,511
and that's what this does.

141
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:24,483
We're gonna loop through all the tags

142
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,010
and print out the href.

143
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,123
So if you tell it to go to dr-chuck.com

144
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:33,504
it will tell you the one
external link in dr-chuck.com.

145
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:36,241
And so, I've got an assignment
that sort of goes into that

146
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:38,199
in some more detail.

147
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,354
But this chapter has been

148
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:42,854
a whole bunch of interesting stuff.

149
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:45,621
We started with the TCP/IP model

150
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,596
and talked about sockets
that are phone calls

151
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,139
between computers.

152
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,952
And then how applications

153
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:52,954
protocols are developed

154
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:55,020
to say what we say on those phone calls

155
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,981
And we've explored then the HTTP protocol,

156
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:01,406
which is probably the most
likely thing you're going to see.

157
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:03,473
And then we played with
all this in Python,

158
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:06,962
and saw that Python is
really good at this.

159
00:06:06,962 --> 00:06:10,178
You can write extremely
simple and small programs

160
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:13,955
to do some extremely
complex and powerful things.

161
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:16,377
And again, that's why people like Python,

162
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:22,583
is because it makes the complex simple.

163
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,083
(light music)
