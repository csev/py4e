1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,666
- In this section, we're
gonna write a web browser

2
00:00:02,666 --> 00:00:03,499
using Python.

3
00:00:03,499 --> 00:00:04,666
So we've already got a socket,

4
00:00:04,666 --> 00:00:06,101
we know how to write a socket.

5
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:08,131
In the previous section we played with

6
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:11,595
the protocol and used
Tellnet to do it by hand,

7
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,285
and now we're gonna do it in Python.

8
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:18,217
And what you're gonna find
is it's not that hard.

9
00:00:18,217 --> 00:00:19,334
So here we go.

10
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:23,074
So the first three lines of
this program, import socket,

11
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:23,907
make the socket.

12
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:25,888
Remember, the socket isn't really

13
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:29,274
got the connection, so you
make the socket, again,

14
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:30,620
we're gonna make a stream-based socket,

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,004
and it's suitable for
going across the internet.

16
00:00:33,004 --> 00:00:36,013
The connection that's
like ring, phone call,

17
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:40,409
connect to data dot P R
four E dot org and port 80.

18
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,646
So that basically says
send the socket across

19
00:00:43,646 --> 00:00:45,774
and connect to a web server,

20
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:48,112
and so there's gotta be a
piece of software running

21
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:52,557
and this will blow up if the
software is not running, okay?

22
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:54,861
So then, now we've got a phone.

23
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:56,287
We've made a phone call.

24
00:00:56,287 --> 00:00:59,416
Now whether or not the
remote side says hello or not

25
00:00:59,416 --> 00:01:01,915
is up to the application protocol,

26
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:04,196
and in this case, the
web servers say nothing,

27
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:05,671
and they wait for you to talk first,

28
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:07,640
so we're the web browser in this case,

29
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,313
and so we're gonna talk first,

30
00:01:09,313 --> 00:01:11,838
and we know what, because
we read the documentation,

31
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,106
we know that we're gonna
send get blah blah blah

32
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:15,361
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

33
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:17,095
Space blah blah blah blah blah H D one,

34
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:18,846
and then two new lines.

35
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:21,144
Return, return, remember you
had to have a blank line?

36
00:01:21,144 --> 00:01:23,061
We'll talk a little
bit about this end code

37
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:25,537
It's preparing the data
to go across the internet,

38
00:01:25,537 --> 00:01:27,528
and then we say send it.

39
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:29,664
And so this basically
takes that little string

40
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:31,704
and sends it across the network,

41
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:34,862
and then this piece of
software is waiting for it

42
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:37,196
and then the software
goes and reads the file

43
00:01:37,196 --> 00:01:39,385
or does some other stuff and
then it starts sending us

44
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:43,374
data back, which we can
then choose to receive.

45
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:45,422
So now I write a real simple loop.

46
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:47,078
We're gonna receive the
first, we're gonna receive

47
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:49,441
these things 512 characters at a time,

48
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:52,676
so we're gonna loop through
receiving 512 each time,

49
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:56,132
and if we get zero
characters, that means it's

50
00:01:56,132 --> 00:01:58,488
end of the stream, the stream is closed.

51
00:01:58,488 --> 00:02:00,120
And if you look at the little example

52
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,297
from the previous one,
you saw connection closed.

53
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:04,870
When the connection is
closed, we get an indication

54
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,970
that it is because we ask for some data

55
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,196
and we get zero data.

56
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:11,187
Otherwise if there might
be more data, this'll wait.

57
00:02:11,187 --> 00:02:12,550
If the network is slow, you'll see

58
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,987
if you do print statement in here,

59
00:02:13,987 --> 00:02:16,145
you will see that this will
pause from time to time

60
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:17,590
on a really slow network.

61
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,523
If your network is fast,
it'll just go blank,

62
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:21,431
and it'll be so fast it won't matter.

63
00:02:21,431 --> 00:02:22,938
But this is how we go.

64
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:26,251
So this is basically
until the entire socket,

65
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,282
until the socket is closed,

66
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,221
we are going to read this data,

67
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:32,717
and because this data's
coming from the outside world

68
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:35,391
we have to decode it before we print it,

69
00:02:35,391 --> 00:02:37,312
and then when we're all
done we break out of here

70
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:38,637
and we close the socket.

71
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:44,875
So literally that is an entire web browser

72
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:48,661
written in 10 lines of Python.

73
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:51,987
And again, this is why
everybody loves Python.

74
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:56,025
So this is what this program
will show if you run.

75
00:02:56,025 --> 00:02:57,021
The get is sent.

76
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:00,161
It looks exactly like doing it by hand.

77
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:01,833
You get some headers.

78
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,845
Again, this is metadata.

79
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:04,816
It tells you something about the file.

80
00:03:04,816 --> 00:03:06,171
In this case, one of the important things

81
00:03:06,171 --> 00:03:07,745
is what kind of thing is coming next.

82
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:09,437
There's always a blank line between,

83
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:12,347
as a break between the
headers and the actual data,

84
00:03:12,347 --> 00:03:13,941
the metadata and the data,

85
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,693
and then here is the actual
text of that romeo dot

86
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:20,414
txt file, and then it's
just gonna run this,

87
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:21,532
print data dot decode.

88
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:23,559
All this is coming from
the print statement.

89
00:03:23,559 --> 00:03:25,688
If you were gonna parse
this, you have to know

90
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,488
that you're gonna read the headers

91
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:28,676
up to a little blank line.

92
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:31,953
The blank line is your indication
as a software developer

93
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:33,140
that the headers have stopped,

94
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,555
and the actual text begins,

95
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:36,090
and you know the syntax.

96
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,726
This actually could be a jpeg or a png

97
00:03:39,726 --> 00:03:41,237
or some kind of image, right?

98
00:03:41,237 --> 00:03:43,376
And this data right here
would like like blech.

99
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:45,553
So if you type this and
you change that code

100
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:48,474
to actually talk, go retrieve a jpeg url,

101
00:03:48,474 --> 00:03:50,592
gibberish will come out, okay?

102
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:53,561
And so that's exactly what you will see.

103
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:58,292
And so now you have built
a very simple web browser.

104
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,164
Next I wanna talk a little bit about

105
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:04,093
what happens when characters transition

106
00:04:04,093 --> 00:04:06,934
from outside your computer,
I mean from inside

107
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:09,547
the computer in strings,
out across the sockets

108
00:04:09,547 --> 00:04:14,071
to servers and then back.

109
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:16,571
(metal music)
