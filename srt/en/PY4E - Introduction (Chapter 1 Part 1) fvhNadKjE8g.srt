00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,890
Hello everybody and welcome to chapter

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,810
one of Python for Everybody. I'm Charles

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,180
Severance i'm your instructor and i

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,670
welcome you to this class.  The basic goal

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,099
of this class is to teach everybody how

6
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,719
to program regardless of your background.

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,940
You don't have to be a math whiz.  You

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,900
don't have to be a computer expert.  No

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,060
matter how old you are or what your

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,500
background is we want to teach you how

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,269
to program.  So welcome to this course.

12
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,830
Welcome to chapter one.

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,480
So the first thing to understand is that

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,300
the purpose to learn to program is

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,010
because computers want to do things for

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,890
us they are built and created and

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,040
designed and their hardware is set up so

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,879
that they basically asked us what do you

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,800
want to do next if you grab your phone

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,219
your phone sort of does nothing until

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,160
you tell it what to do with weights for

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,649
you and is just waiting for you and all

23
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,350
the hardware computer technology around

24
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,890
you is generally waiting for you and we

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,930
can use this for useful things we could

26
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:10,409
play video games we could have it help

27
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,080
navigate for our car someday we might

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,619
even have self-driving cars and its

29
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,700
really in a sense in my mind silly if

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,189
you spend your whole life not really

31
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,350
understanding this technology and and I

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,450
think it's important that we learn to

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,670
tell these computers what to do rather

34
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,280
than just let them increasingly control

35
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,060
our lives and so as we'll see computers

36
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,250
aren't very smart on their own we humans

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,509
are the ones that in view them with

38
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,729
knowledge and what we need to learn to

39
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,740
speak their language it is much easier

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,290
for us to learn to speak their language

41
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,909
than it is for them to learn to speak

42
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,770
our language although with these

43
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,540
cellphones we're starting to see little

44
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,790
bits where they can begin to understand

45
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,270
but you would be amazed at the 40 or 50

46
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,909
years that it takes has taken us to

47
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,969
understand a hundred to build programs

48
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,000
to begin to understand so I'm bringing

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,550
you into something where you are going

50
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,869
to learn the ways of programming

51
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,849
in the let ways of the computer because

52
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:14,830
it's easier to teach you how to program

53
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,560
is to teach this how to work in your

54
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,019
world even though ultimately the goal is

55
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:23,500
to get this to to do work for you

56
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,629
so part of what i'm trying to do is move

57
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,940
you from a user perspective where you

58
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,769
just look at the computer as something

59
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,010
that someone else has constructed and

60
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,860
you are the user of to the point where

61
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,360
you construct new things now the first

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,470
kinds of things that you're going to

63
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,150
construct are actually things to solve

64
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:42,519
your own problems and it's a very

65
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:45,370
popular now to work on data and python

66
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,900
is an excellent programming language for

67
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,540
datum data mining and data analysis and

68
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,709
that's a lot of what we're going to do

69
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:52,090
in this course although really it's a

70
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,519
gateway to all kinds of things like you

71
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,680
know artificial intelligence or gaming

72
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,230
navigation or mobile applications or

73
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,690
entertainment all kinds of things but

74
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,549
first we have to learn to program we

75
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:06,190
have to move from using the computer as

76
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,170
a tool to using the tools within the

77
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,109
computer that allow us to change how the

78
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,650
computer sees the world so there's a

79
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,090
couple of reasons that you might want to

80
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,069
be a programmer some of you are looking

81
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:21,340
to improve your career to be paid to

82
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,870
work on program and I've been a paid

83
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,450
program for most of my life and I like

84
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,060
it it's a good job you don't have to

85
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,079
stand in the mud you don't have to lift

86
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,239
things you have to use your brain and

87
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,910
i'll just say that it is been nice for

88
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,370
my career to not be exposed to the

89
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,989
elements but to be able to work often

90
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:44,349
wherever I want but that's actually our

91
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,720
secondary goal our first goal is to get

92
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,280
you to write programs that solve

93
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,900
problems that you have to solve maybe

94
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,299
you have a job as an accountant or a

95
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,720
lawyer or something else and maybe you

96
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,400
run across some data maybe there's some

97
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,370
system that logs your time and it's not

98
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,870
quite giving the report that you want to

99
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,519
give and so you say could I just grabbed

100
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,440
the log data myself and and write a

101
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,329
program to do some analysis to say

102
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:10,690
what's the average this versus that or

103
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,669
the average of some other thing right

104
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,750
and so that's the basic idea that you'll

105
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,209
you'll initially use computers to serve

106
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,709
your own ends

107
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,419
that makes it a lot easier to write

108
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:23,919
programs because you don't have to worry

109
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:24,460
about

110
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,020
you know a million users using your

111
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:28,000
software you if it works for you then

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,460
we're happy and so it takes a little

113
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,139
more training to write software for

114
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,639
other people are for thousands and

115
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,660
thousands of other people and so part of

116
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,580
what i want to do is I want to change

117
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,150
your perspective you know you look at

118
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,520
this from the outside and you see it

119
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,650
from the outside and you click on things

120
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,650
i want to turn this around and I want

121
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,110
you to be the person inside this looking

122
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,020
out at the world and as a programmer we

123
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,259
are making things inside these computers

124
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,289
for the world and so we want to pull you

125
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:04,960
into being part of this we want you

126
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,979
inside this are thinking inside this and

127
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:12,099
what you learn is that if you're inside

128
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:15,039
this computer and you are taking your

129
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,960
instructions to build programs to be

130
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,199
used by the human almost dropped that

131
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,900
the human outside the computer you have

132
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,849
things that you need to take advantage

133
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:26,860
of there's things like the central

134
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,300
processing unit the memory of this

135
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,770
system the network connection of this

136
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,259
system that the disk drive or permanent

137
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,000
storage on this system and as a

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,820
programmer you are kind of mediating

139
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,919
between all those internal resources

140
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:40,840
that this has that are not very smart

141
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,780
but highly powerful and mediating with

142
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,060
what that user wants right and so we

143
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,490
take the end user and we programmers we

144
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,680
serve the end-user but the computer

145
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,310
serves us so together between us and all

146
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,469
the computers resources we can serve the

147
00:05:56,469 --> 00:06:00,039
needs of the end user and we do this by

148
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,719
writing code or programming ok and what

149
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:06,400
is that well

150
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,409
programming is a sequence of

151
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,360
instructions where we are giving

152
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,159
instructions the resources inside the

153
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,289
computer in a way to accomplish the

154
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,820
goals of the end user and remember

155
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,000
sometimes we are our own end-user it's

156
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,990
not just it's not just you know the

157
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,580
you're not always doing a start-up

158
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,900
you're not always writing a mobile

159
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,210
gaming system sometimes you're writing

160
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,950
something for yourself but that's okay

161
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,160
so sometimes you're writing something to

162
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,380
solve a problem you're like crafting

163
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,120
your you're doing something you could do

164
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,700
by hand or manually and you're you're

165
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,670
making some clever little 2500 line

166
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,720
program and you're putting that in other

167
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,670
times like when I work on the

168
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,110
open-source learning management system

169
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,410
sakai it is my creativity I'm I've got

170
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,030
an idea and I want to share it with a

171
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,880
million users and so I write my code to

172
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,970
for an external audience and so code is

173
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,560
that sequence of instructions that the

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,050
computer itself doesn't know how to

175
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,080
handle roster out but i can write code

176
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,580
that will handle roster out by looking

177
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,310
at the data that's inside this computer

178
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,860
inside this application and so if you

179
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,140
think about programs we have programs

180
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,050
for computers and programs for humans

181
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,570
and a number of years ago now i'm

182
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,400
started sooner or later this will be me

183
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,960
showing my age

184
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,870
this is an example of the macarena and

185
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,910
the macarena is a song that effectively

186
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,860
is a sequence of instructions

187
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,570
you put your left hand out you put your

188
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,130
right hand out you put on the shoulder

189
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,200
you wiggle wiggle wiggle and you spin

190
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,400
around and you do things and this this

191
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,520
is a program for people and so I want

192
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,700
you to take a quick look at this and see

193
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,950
if you can find anything wrong with this

194
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,980
particular program to look really

195
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,600
closely

196
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,840
so i'll show you it's got some

197
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,760
typographical errors in it and we as

198
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,050
humans are really good at reading or

199
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,510
hearing typographical errors and

200
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,100
correcting them automatically and

201
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,220
instantly and but computers are not

202
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,500
computers are extremely literal if it

203
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,410
saw this ham instead of hand it would

204
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,440
think what's a ham and why am I going to

205
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,700
hit someone in the back of the head with

206
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,000
a ham and why would I take my left hand

207
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,740
and hit somebody that's you know these

208
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,810
are all bad things but the computer is

209
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:43,570
going to take us very literally

210
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,050
and so we have to be really precise and

211
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,120
and the computer just doesn't know the

212
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,910
difference between what we mean and what

213
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,820
we say so we have to be very precise and

214
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
this is one of the great frustrations

215
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,340
that people have when they first start

216
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,130
using computers and so we have to get

217
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,200
this right we have to get these little

218
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,150
bits of text exactly the way they are

219
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,070
computers will blow up with syntax

220
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,200
errors and there seemed to to make quite

221
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,910
a fuss when you make the tiniest of

222
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,010
errors but you'll get used to that I

223
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,380
mean that's because not because you're

224
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,590
bad or you're less than awesome

225
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,840
it just means the computers can't

226
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,910
compensate when you make small mistakes

227
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,080
and so you've got to get used to the

228
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,870
fact that the computer is sort of

229
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,060
intellectually not as strong as you

230
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,490
and so it gets confused really easy even

231
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,020
though when it gets confused

232
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,060
it says seemingly mean things to you so

233
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,470
you'll get used to that

234
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,310
ok so the first thing i want to do is I

235
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,930
want to throw up some text and I want

236
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,630
you to while this text is up i want you

237
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,330
to count the number of each word in this

238
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,640
text and tell me what the most common

239
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,430
word is in this text

240
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,420
ok so here we go

241
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:17,149
ok so I I kind of made that hard on you

242
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:18,800
on purpose by moving around and

243
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
distracting you and confusing you

244
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,970
but even if it's it's not moving at all

245
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,790
it's a little bit you know tricky to do

246
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,279
you probably stare at a couple of times

247
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,600
your brain is going back and forth and

248
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,089
back and forth and so let's text

249
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,620
analysis is one of the great things that

250
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,709
computers are very very good at and some

251
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:38,240
of the things that you know if they can

252
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,490
translate text and that's because they

253
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,930
looked at a lot of information so

254
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,250
looking at text is actually something

255
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,430
computers are really good at and so if

256
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,709
we take a look at the kind of programs

257
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,120
that we're going to write to do this

258
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,320
kind of thing

259
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,329
this is something that humans are not

260
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:54,889
naturally good at but computers are

261
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:57,769
super-good at now i'm not going to have

262
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,839
you look at this code i'm not going to

263
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:01,550
this code you will understand in a few

264
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,100
weeks but basically this is a set of

265
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,399
instructions to open a file read that

266
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,890
file read all the words in the file

267
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,500
create a histogram of all the words in

268
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,990
the file and then search through that

269
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:16,910
histogram to find the most common word

270
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,640
and tell us what the most common word is

271
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,550
in the file and in this clown file the

272
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,380
word that is the most common it happened

273
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,300
seven times and here's another large

274
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,730
file called words that text and the word

275
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,279
to is the most common thing and our goal

276
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,110
is to get to the point where you can

277
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,420
write this on your own so you can say

278
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,949
you know what I got a problem to solve

279
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:39,199
that is what's the most common word in

280
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,100
this file

281
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,860
I know how to start and then I know how

282
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,600
to finish I know how to do this stuff in

283
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,190
the middle and we have to learn this

284
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:50,000
kind of weird language but when we do we

285
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,310
can count millions of words as easily as

286
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,370
account 20 words so that's the fun of

287
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,380
all of this is to teach you this

288
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,449
language so that you can solve that

289
00:11:59,449 --> 00:12:01,880
problem so that you don't have to solve

290
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,800
it because you could solve it but it's

291
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,569
not something that's not your naturally

292
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:08,480
good at and it's hard work

293
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,130
so next we're going to talk a little bit

294
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,410
about the hardware architecture that you

295
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,420
can you're going to be experiencing as

296
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:20,019
you write programs
