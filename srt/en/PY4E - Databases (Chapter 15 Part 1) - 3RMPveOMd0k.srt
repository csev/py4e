00:00:00,648 --> 00:00:03,582
- Hello and welcome to
our chapter on databases.

2
00:00:03,582 --> 00:00:05,848
We're gonna learn a lot in this chapter.

3
00:00:05,848 --> 00:00:08,321
Learn a whole new
programming language, SQL

4
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:10,573
and learn how to use that.

5
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:12,292
So you're gonna need a
new piece of software

6
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:15,740
to run all of the
exercises that I'm gonna do

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,042
called SQLite browser.

8
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:19,179
We're using a database called SQLite.

9
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:20,583
Go ahead and download this,

10
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,882
you might have to pause
and come back if you like.

11
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:27,091
Go to sqlitebrowser.org and
download it and install.

12
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:28,690
While you're doing that,

13
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:31,090
we'll talk a little bit about the history.

14
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,061
In the old days, 1960s 1970s

15
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:38,783
I started doing computing in 1975.

16
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:41,000
We didn't have a lot of storage.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,540
I mean this is 16 gigabytes right here

18
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,325
and we didn't even have megabytes.

19
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:50,677
The computer I had had a
few megabytes of stuff.

20
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:52,415
We also we didn't have
a lot of disk drives

21
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:55,781
and so permanent storage
was often sequential.

22
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:58,776
These tapes, these tape drives that we had

23
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:01,744
tapes and tape drives were
the scale part of storage

24
00:01:01,744 --> 00:01:02,844
'cause you could just make more tapes

25
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:05,677
and you could rack them
up and so that was our way

26
00:01:05,677 --> 00:01:07,648
of greatly increasing the
storage of the computer.

27
00:01:07,648 --> 00:01:10,593
The problem they had was
is they were sequential.

28
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:12,649
You read it, it advances,
read it, advance,

29
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:13,482
read and advance.

30
00:01:13,482 --> 00:01:16,671
Now interestingly we've been
writing programs that do this

31
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:17,887
that everything we've written so far

32
00:01:17,887 --> 00:01:19,733
pretty much reads the whole file,

33
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:21,356
reads the whole web page, reads this.

34
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:22,189
Everything we read it.

35
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,545
We read either a loop
or read the whole thing

36
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:26,147
and that's 'cause we have plenty of memory

37
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:29,131
but we're still reading sequentially.

38
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,812
And so the way you would do this

39
00:01:31,812 --> 00:01:34,645
when you didn't have
enough spinning storage

40
00:01:34,645 --> 00:01:36,825
or online storage is
you used offline storage

41
00:01:36,825 --> 00:01:39,077
but the trick would be
that you would sort it.

42
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:40,459
So let's imagine that you're a bank

43
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,270
and you have a bunch of accounts

44
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,487
only a few of which are active on any day

45
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:48,011
and you have a tape that
has in account number

46
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:49,520
order from low to high,

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,326
the prior balance, last night's balance

48
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,297
of every one of your bank accounts

49
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:56,631
and then you do all the transactions

50
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:59,777
and you record how much
money was taken in or out

51
00:01:59,777 --> 00:02:00,714
for each account number

52
00:02:00,714 --> 00:02:02,363
and then you sort those transactions.

53
00:02:02,363 --> 00:02:03,501
And then what you do

54
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:05,672
is what we call a
sequential master update.

55
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:08,702
And that is, you would write a program

56
00:02:08,702 --> 00:02:11,117
that would read the first
transaction and hold on to it.

57
00:02:11,117 --> 00:02:13,787
So okay this is account 45.

58
00:02:13,787 --> 00:02:15,703
Then it would read the
first count like one

59
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,711
and it would copy one then it'd read two

60
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:21,075
and read like seven, eight, 42, 43.

61
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:23,165
Then it would read like 44.

62
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:26,157
Now it would read 45 but
now it would change that

63
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:29,083
and write the new 45
and read the next thing

64
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,673
and so this might be 60.

65
00:02:30,673 --> 00:02:32,067
And then it would read a bunch of stuff

66
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,628
and copy a bunch of stuff

67
00:02:33,628 --> 00:02:35,555
and then it would finally
get to 60 and it would merge

68
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:39,549
the add or subtract and so
the old balance ended up here

69
00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:40,896
and the new balance did here.

70
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:43,276
And you had to only make
one pass through the data

71
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:45,319
so it was super efficient.

72
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,571
So we had all these mechanisms to sort.

73
00:02:47,571 --> 00:02:49,847
We used to do punch cards and have sorters

74
00:02:49,847 --> 00:02:50,680
and all these things

75
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,804
and then these things would run for hours.

76
00:02:54,804 --> 00:02:57,684
And if you watch old TV shows
these tapes are spinning

77
00:02:57,684 --> 00:02:59,448
and these things are
running back and forth.

78
00:02:59,448 --> 00:03:02,499
These are simply reading and writing tapes

79
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:04,716
and that's how we did a
lot of data processing

80
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:08,536
because we could store
far more on a tape drive

81
00:03:08,536 --> 00:03:12,181
than we could on a disk and
with racks of tape drives

82
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:16,082
we could scale the storage
that our computers had.

83
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:17,522
So that's the way we did data processing

84
00:03:17,522 --> 00:03:20,299
but it meant that the only way you knew

85
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:21,530
what the old balance was

86
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,666
was it was the balance as of this morning

87
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:24,894
before you bank started.

88
00:03:24,894 --> 00:03:26,574
You don't know what the
balance was for the day

89
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:30,564
and that led to things like

90
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:33,094
you can never withdraw
more than $100 a day

91
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:33,927
or something like that

92
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:36,052
because you don't know
what the old balance was

93
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:37,906
or you might go withdraw a $100

94
00:03:37,906 --> 00:03:39,792
at a couple of different branches

95
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:43,945
and so they weren't able to
look your stuff upright away.

96
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:47,262
Now it didn't take long
until the disk drives

97
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:48,571
got better and better and better

98
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:52,112
and you could store the entire accounts,

99
00:03:52,112 --> 00:03:55,015
all the accounts and the
current balances on computers.

100
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:57,441
And the problem becomes is

101
00:03:57,441 --> 00:03:59,502
what happens if in the
middle of the afternoon

102
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:00,892
you want to update a balance.

103
00:04:00,892 --> 00:04:03,191
Well, do you want to read all your data

104
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,537
and then write a brand new one

105
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:07,080
and say that takes like 10 minutes.

106
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,216
That means for that 10
minutes only one person

107
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:11,840
can be updating their bank balance.

108
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,497
And because we could
randomly access this data,

109
00:04:15,497 --> 00:04:16,937
we didn't have to read
it all sequentially.

110
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:20,233
The trick was, how do
you spread the data out

111
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:23,346
and then how do you make it
so you can change a balance?

112
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,901
This is of course second nature today

113
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:27,061
but how do you make it so
you change a balance here

114
00:04:27,061 --> 00:04:28,883
without changing the balance there

115
00:04:28,883 --> 00:04:29,794
and you can have multiple people

116
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:31,733
going simultaneously through these things?

117
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,707
And make sure that you can't say

118
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:36,435
withdraw money at two different
locations simultaneously

119
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:39,767
and somehow have your bank
balance get corrupted by that.

120
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,567
So there's a lot of
debate on how to do that.

121
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:45,143
And early days we just did
sequential master update.

122
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:47,569
But increasingly we
wanted to make better use

123
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:52,085
of the random nature of our
computers and our storage.

124
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:54,605
And so that's what led to databases.

125
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:59,864
Databases are the science
of how you make use of

126
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:03,736
rotating random access
data, permanent data,

127
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,336
in a way that allows you to read, modify

128
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:09,459
and update that simultaneously
from many different locations

129
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:12,470
and yet keep the data
completely consistent.

130
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,510
And so this led to a study

131
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,579
of a thing called relational databases.

132
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:20,319
Relational databases are
not the only databases

133
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,677
that happened.

134
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:23,114
We had many other kinds of databases.

135
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,446
And there was a debate and I
remember in the 70s and 80s

136
00:05:26,446 --> 00:05:28,886
there was folks that said oh no no there,

137
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:31,266
you could do index sequential,
that's the was to do it.

138
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:35,434
And relational databases
weren't all that popular.

139
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,486
The first time that I saw them,

140
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:40,701
I didn't like relational databases.

141
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:43,523
Relational databases had
an inherent advantage

142
00:05:43,523 --> 00:05:46,448
because they were based on some
really powerful mathematics.

143
00:05:46,448 --> 00:05:48,538
The interesting thing is, is early on

144
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:50,837
the relational databases were slower

145
00:05:50,837 --> 00:05:52,752
but eventually they figured out

146
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,935
how to sort of bring all
the cleverness to bear

147
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:56,537
to make relational databases fast.

148
00:05:56,537 --> 00:05:59,660
And so relational databases
are a pretty advanced

149
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,467
technology and there're
companies like Oracle

150
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:05,462
that are very very wealthy
and their primary product

151
00:06:05,462 --> 00:06:07,168
for many many years was nothing more than

152
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:09,318
a clever database product.

153
00:06:09,318 --> 00:06:11,509
A clever piece of software
that was really good

154
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:12,565
at solving this problem.

155
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:16,106
And that's how important this
problem was to computing.

156
00:06:16,106 --> 00:06:17,128
If you read about databases,

157
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:19,346
you're going to see two
sets of terminology.

158
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:21,563
One set of terminology comes from

159
00:06:21,563 --> 00:06:24,152
the mathematical background.

160
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:26,532
And it has to do with the underlying math,

161
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:29,458
things like relations,
tuples, and attributes.

162
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:33,100
That's kind of like the
fancy math version of it

163
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,935
and programmers kind of think of them as

164
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:38,007
rows and columns inside of a table.

165
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:40,291
And so if you look at
sort of fancy theory,

166
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,869
you'll see words that look like this,

167
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,378
and they're just full of
this and the connection.

168
00:06:45,378 --> 00:06:47,644
Now all this is important and true,

169
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:48,628
and if you really want to get good

170
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:51,380
you sort of begin to
understand the nature that

171
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,939
we model data at connections rather than

172
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,588
at sort of intersection points

173
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:59,431
rather than just modeling data
as a flat file the way we do.

174
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:02,426
But for now we're going to as programmers

175
00:07:02,426 --> 00:07:03,657
think of this as just like,

176
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,292
oh, it's like a super fast spreadsheet.

177
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,894
The super fast part is the math,

178
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,437
for us the rows, columns
and tables are spreadsheets.

179
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:13,046
So it thinks of thinking
a spreadsheet of sheets.

180
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:14,291
Sheet, sheet, sheet.

181
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,915
And that's like a table, a named thing

182
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:19,713
like tracks or albums, artists or genres.

183
00:07:19,713 --> 00:07:21,570
And then there is rows, and each row

184
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,506
has a different kind of data.

185
00:07:23,506 --> 00:07:26,559
And then there's columns,
and we sort of specialized

186
00:07:26,559 --> 00:07:27,912
the first column in many spreadsheets

187
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:29,386
to say what's in there.

188
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:32,672
This is not really the
data, this is like metadata.

189
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:34,355
It's like the titles in this first column,

190
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:36,712
that's not really the data
and the data starts here.

191
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:37,905
And we have different kinds of data

192
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:40,409
like strings and numbers,
et cetera, et cetera,

193
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,871
for each of the rows.

194
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:46,467
And literally you can get away with this

195
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,278
as sort of about 80% of databases

196
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:50,240
is just a really super cool spreadsheet.

197
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,325
But under the covers, it is
far more powerful than that.

198
00:07:55,325 --> 00:07:59,101
So one of the early
arguments that happened was

199
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:01,237
again what the programming
model for this was.

200
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:03,954
And a lot of folks wanted
a programming model

201
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:07,239
that reflected how the
data was actually stored.

202
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:10,397
The notion of Structured
Query Language came about

203
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:13,973
in a way to express what
you wanted to happen

204
00:08:13,973 --> 00:08:17,154
and allow that to be sort of
a very abstract expression.

205
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:19,813
Select all records that meet this criteria

206
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:22,842
not read read read read read read.

207
00:08:22,842 --> 00:08:25,518
And so Structured Query Language is

208
00:08:25,518 --> 00:08:28,082
not a procedural language.

209
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:29,861
It is a imperative language,

210
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:31,750
where you're simply saying what you want

211
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,445
and then somebody writes the loop.

212
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:34,792
The database actually does loop

213
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:37,342
but it's a way for you to avoid
actually writing the loop.

214
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:40,373
Now that turns out to be
the power of databases

215
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:42,135
'cause the cleverness
on how to write the loop

216
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:44,631
is a way that you would
probably never figure out

217
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:47,661
how to be most supremely optimal

218
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,345
when it comes to writing the loop.

219
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:52,061
As you'll see toward the
end of joining many tables

220
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:53,663
together and selecting and throwing array

221
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,321
and getting down a count or whatever,

222
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:58,525
someone has figured out how
to do that really really well.

223
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:01,401
So the idea was you would express,

224
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:02,643
we're going to create some data,

225
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,793
we're going to retrieve some data,

226
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,287
we're going to insert and delete it.

227
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:06,971
Create, read,

228
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:10,047
crud, C-R-U-D.

229
00:09:10,047 --> 00:09:13,171
Create, read, update, and delete, crud.

230
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:14,564
And so that's what this does,

231
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:17,153
it's a language that
does this very simply.

232
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:21,414
Now the applications that
we're going to use this for,

233
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:23,503
are more of a data analysis application.

234
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:26,673
We've been doing data analysis
through the whole course.

235
00:09:26,673 --> 00:09:28,365
And the kinds of things
that we'll see in the

236
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:31,360
remaining chapters is we'll
take some raw data file,

237
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,519
these might actually
come across the network,

238
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,288
and well write some Python
programs to play with

239
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:40,783
that data, parse it, clean
it up, make sense of it,

240
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:42,559
and then write it into a database.

241
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,999
And this might be a slow processor,

242
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:45,183
this might be really nasty

243
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:47,610
and this might be a way
to have very clean data.

244
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,421
And then we'll write
another Python program

245
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:51,464
to sort of read this, read through it,

246
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:53,566
and it's all efficient and pretty.

247
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:56,654
And then we can produce files
and maybe we'll visualize it

248
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:59,555
or do further analysis in our Excel

249
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:02,063
or a JavaScript visualization framework.

250
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:06,289
And so in this situation
you will be the person

251
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:09,002
who is both sort of writing the programs,

252
00:10:09,002 --> 00:10:12,958
database administrator and
you can, using SQLite Browser,

253
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,338
play and look at database
kind of in a raw way.

254
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:16,929
And the first part of this, we are mostly

255
00:10:16,929 --> 00:10:18,821
going to be using SQLite Browser

256
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:20,411
just to talk straight to a database.

257
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,556
Later we'll write Python
programs that read and write data

258
00:10:24,556 --> 00:10:26,195
and visualize the data.

259
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:28,285
So this is what we're going to do first

260
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:30,723
and then second we're going
to do this part right here,

261
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:33,556
that's the second thing we're going to do.

262
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:36,345
Now another really common
use of applications

263
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:38,774
and something that if you
continue learning more

264
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:42,982
about programming, is that
you will want to write

265
00:10:42,982 --> 00:10:46,842
an online application
like Amazon or a company

266
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:49,556
or Twitter, that's got a website

267
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:52,688
and it stores dynamic data in databases.

268
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:55,811
And so the picture for that
is similar but different

269
00:10:55,811 --> 00:10:57,367
than the picture we're
going to start out with.

270
00:10:57,367 --> 00:11:01,314
And so the way this usually
works is that you, the end user,

271
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:04,066
uses a web browser,
talks to the application,

272
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:07,549
and the developer writes
the application software,

273
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:09,522
and that application
software stores its data

274
00:11:09,522 --> 00:11:12,982
in a database and inside that database,

275
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:15,351
we talk to the database using SQL,

276
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:17,104
and all the data is actually stored here

277
00:11:17,104 --> 00:11:19,159
and the magic happens,
the data server is that

278
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,131
database software that's
so precious and valuable.

279
00:11:22,131 --> 00:11:23,965
And then there's another
person often called

280
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:26,682
the database administrator
who has access to the

281
00:11:26,682 --> 00:11:28,273
direct access to the data.

282
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:30,397
And these roles in
medium and large projects

283
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:38,858
are kept separate mostly because

284
00:11:38,858 --> 00:11:42,642
the production, while
it's running and live,

285
00:11:42,642 --> 00:11:44,407
the developer leaves the data alone

286
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:47,260
and works on let's say the
next version of the software.

287
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,378
And then the developer
has a tester version

288
00:11:49,378 --> 00:11:53,262
of the application that
they run on their computer

289
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,571
where they're doing all that stuff.

290
00:11:54,571 --> 00:11:57,810
And so this database
administrator is a role

291
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,142
in a large project where
we have to run production

292
00:12:01,142 --> 00:12:05,751
and keep production careful,
keep production in good shape.

293
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:08,004
So a database administrator
has this responsibility

294
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:10,175
for the production aspects of the data.

295
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:11,991
And you may be working
in a situation where that

296
00:12:11,991 --> 00:12:13,640
you're not actually controlling the data,

297
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,695
the database server's
on different computers.

298
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:17,251
You have little special access

299
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:20,475
and you write programs
to sort of read the data.

300
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,658
And so the database
administrator is the person

301
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:27,673
who is asked by the organization
to administer that data.

302
00:12:27,673 --> 00:12:29,368
The data that we develop,

303
00:12:29,368 --> 00:12:33,132
and we'll do this in a second
part of these lectures,

304
00:12:33,132 --> 00:12:35,312
conforms to a data model,
that's the metadata.

305
00:12:35,312 --> 00:12:37,588
Is this an integer, is this a string,

306
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:39,155
how many columns is this?

307
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,860
And the data model turns out
to be very very important

308
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,706
and there's a lot of science
to building an effective

309
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:46,211
data model that leads to
really good performance.

310
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:48,564
And it's a collaborative activity between

311
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:52,674
the application developers
and the database administrator

312
00:12:52,674 --> 00:12:55,171
to make it so it's efficient,
runs in production,

313
00:12:55,171 --> 00:12:56,866
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

314
00:12:56,866 --> 00:13:00,813
There's a lot of products out
there that you may encounter.

315
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,125
But we're going to be using SQLite.

316
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:04,626
SQLite's a little tiny database server

317
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:05,938
and it's built into so many things

318
00:13:05,938 --> 00:13:07,088
and that's why we like it.

319
00:13:07,088 --> 00:13:09,395
But if you're going to work
in a large organization

320
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:10,753
you could easily run into Oracle

321
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:14,434
which is the number
one commercial product.

322
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:16,408
Microsoft has a thing called SqlServer

323
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:19,356
which is a commercial product
and it's also very popular

324
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:21,118
and very effective.

325
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:23,463
The more popular open source,

326
00:13:23,463 --> 00:13:25,016
there's things called Postgres,

327
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:28,391
there's MySql, and MySql
recently was sort of bought

328
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:33,500
by Oracle, and there's a
copy of that called MariaDB

329
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,162
that doesn't belong to Oracle, MariaDB.

330
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:40,637
Most of the SQL that we're gonna learn

331
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:45,183
is common across these database systems

332
00:13:45,183 --> 00:13:47,108
because SQL's a standard,
but then there are parts

333
00:13:47,108 --> 00:13:48,466
that weren't part of the original standard

334
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,593
where each database
avender has done things

335
00:13:50,593 --> 00:13:51,530
a little bit different.

336
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,905
But there is a core common
subset that just does

337
00:13:54,905 --> 00:13:58,469
the basic create, read,
update, and delete operations.

338
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,861
So SQLite is a very popular.

339
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:04,158
You probably have it in your
cellphone, 10, 12 times.

340
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:06,434
Your web browser has a
database engine in it.

341
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:09,197
Your car has a few databases in it.

342
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:13,527
And so SQLite is what's called
an embedded database system.

343
00:14:13,527 --> 00:14:15,544
Python comes built in with it,

344
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:18,993
you just import SQLite3 and away you go.

345
00:14:18,993 --> 00:14:22,670
And so it's a very very
popular because it's free,

346
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,675
it's open source and it's
such a tiny little piece

347
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:28,137
of software that you
just include it in other

348
00:14:28,137 --> 00:14:31,295
pieces of software and use it
to solve the data management

349
00:14:31,295 --> 00:14:32,778
problems of those pieces of software.

350
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:36,179
Like you browser might use
SQLite to store your bookmarks.

351
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,654
Now you think, oh there's
only how many bookmarks

352
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:38,792
can you have.

353
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,730
But what if there you need it to be fast,

354
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,913
and what if there's like people
that have 10,000 bookmarks?

355
00:14:42,913 --> 00:14:44,283
There probably are.

356
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,386
Do you still want it fast?

357
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,219
Do you want to be able to search?

358
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:50,767
And so you get all that by
using a database like SQLite.

359
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:53,180
And so again we're going to
encourage you to download

360
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:56,265
the SQLite browser so
you can follow along with

361
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:58,642
what we're going to do coming up next.

362
00:14:58,642 --> 00:15:00,418
And so here is the SQLite browser.

363
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:01,811
Here's what it looks like,

364
00:15:01,811 --> 00:15:03,692
and it's just a desktop application.

365
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:06,444
And coming up next
we'll start playing with

366
00:15:06,444 --> 00:15:11,123
this desktop application
and see how it works.

367
