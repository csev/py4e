1
00:00:00,542 --> 00:00:03,016
- Hello, and welcome back
to Hardware Architecture.

2
00:00:03,016 --> 00:00:04,157
Now you might ask,

3
00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:07,990
why do I tell you about
hardware architecture?

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,541
Probably you're not
gonna build any hardware,

5
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:14,072
although it's fun stuff to
do and if you're gonna become

6
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:17,375
a computer scientist, which
most of you won't want to be,

7
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,430
it's a great thing to study.

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,455
Those who build our hardware
are amazingly talented

9
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:26,414
individuals and it's a
really rewarding job.

10
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:28,739
The reason I like talking
to you about hardware

11
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:31,919
is because I want to be able
to use words at some point

12
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:33,543
and say, oh, secondary storage,

13
00:00:33,543 --> 00:00:38,133
or central processing unit,
or random access memory,

14
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:40,744
or peripherals, input devices.

15
00:00:40,744 --> 00:00:41,951
And I wanna be able to say those words

16
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:44,171
and I want you to be
able to understand them.

17
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:46,053
I'll start with a little piece of hardware

18
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:47,929
called the Raspberry Pi.

19
00:00:47,929 --> 00:00:51,528
And the Raspberry Pi is a cute
little single-board computer.

20
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:54,424
As we go forward, these things are smaller

21
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:56,318
and smaller and smaller.

22
00:00:56,318 --> 00:00:58,255
And the interesting thing is is that

23
00:00:58,255 --> 00:01:00,126
the architecture of these stays the same

24
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:03,043
but the number of components drops.

25
00:01:03,902 --> 00:01:07,735
I'm gonna start and give you
a block diagram of sort of

26
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:12,297
a generic computer, and tell
you the major parts of it.

27
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:16,083
I'm gonna show you some
really old hardware,

28
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,827
some really new hardware,
and then some hardware

29
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:20,660
that is of medium age.

30
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:23,107
And the medium age hardware is

31
00:01:23,107 --> 00:01:24,659
probably the easiest one to see.

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,991
The architecture is the same, okay?

33
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:32,408
And so the basic block
diagram is that the brains,

34
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:36,199
if there are brains in computers,
which there really aren't.

35
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:38,743
The software is the closest
thing computers have to brains.

36
00:01:38,743 --> 00:01:41,801
But in hardware, the closest
brain the computer has is this,

37
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:45,968
called a micro processing unit,
or a central processor unit.

38
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:51,063
This is designed three
billion times a second

39
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:55,409
to ask the question, what
do you want me to do next?

40
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,642
And these little pins on the
back are our instructions,

41
00:01:58,642 --> 00:02:02,268
like 32 or 64 of these
pins, three billion times

42
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:06,721
a second we send an
instruction into these things.

43
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:10,026
We can't sit there and
talk to it, we can't.

44
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:12,249
So the instructions we store in

45
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:14,245
what's called the main memory.

46
00:02:14,245 --> 00:02:16,168
And this memory is really fast.

47
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:18,582
The memory sort of feeds this.

48
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:21,714
So every time the CPU
needs a new instruction,

49
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:24,279
it asks the memory where
that instruction is.

50
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:26,540
And so the memory feeds
the instruction to the CPU,

51
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,771
the CPU does it, says give
me another instruction,

52
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:30,905
CPU does it, gives me another instruction.

53
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:34,802
And that is the basic
essence of programming.

54
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,853
This asks what's next and this is

55
00:02:36,853 --> 00:02:39,464
where your program is stored, or a program

56
00:02:39,464 --> 00:02:41,834
you purchased or came with your hardware,

57
00:02:41,834 --> 00:02:46,001
where that's all stored,
and those are your places.

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,173
Your programs end up inside this memory.

59
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:58,009
In software you tend to program the CPU.

60
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00,531
And if you had bought a desktop computer

61
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:02,301
a number of years back, it would have

62
00:03:02,301 --> 00:03:04,230
this thing called the motherboard.

63
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,420
And the motherboard is
called this because it

64
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,031
kinda connects all the
components together.

65
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:11,875
And so if you buy memory
by itself, it does nothing,

66
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,338
but it has a place to plug
in to the motherboard.

67
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:16,308
And if you buy a microprocessor,

68
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:20,058
it has a place to plug
in to the motherboard.

69
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:24,325
And if you buy a hard drive,

70
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:28,402
this is a really old hard drive,

71
00:03:28,402 --> 00:03:30,418
it has a place to plug
in on the motherboard.

72
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,933
And so the motherboard sorta
connects everything together.

73
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:35,933
The hard drive is secondary storage.

74
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:41,644
How secondary storage is
different than the main memory,

75
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:45,394
which there it is, I
gotta unpile this stuff.

76
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,545
So this main memory is really
fast, but as soon as you

77
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:54,117
turn the power off of this
memory, it sort of vanishes.

78
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:56,874
And so to store files
like word processing files

79
00:03:56,874 --> 00:04:00,135
or text files, or
whatever, you gotta start

80
00:04:00,135 --> 00:04:02,675
on something that lasts
a little bit longer.

81
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:05,990
And so that's the purpose
of the secondary storage,

82
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,328
it's permanent, when the
power's off, it stores it.

83
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:12,165
Now this one here is in
such bad shape it isn't

84
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:15,483
probably storing anything, but
it's got these little heads

85
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:18,817
and it spins around and goes in and out.

86
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:21,648
We'll have a video later
that shows you one of

87
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:24,091
these things that's not
quite in as bad of shape.

88
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:26,732
If you look, this has
four different platters

89
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:28,744
that are all spinnin' around.

90
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:32,369
So this is just using magnetic
material and electronics

91
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:35,947
that sort of magnetize and
demagnetize this stuff.

92
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:38,584
And if you look at a
disk, they're often rated,

93
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:41,374
physical disks are rated
in revolutions per minute,

94
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:43,717
and that's how many times
this thing spins around.

95
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,499
If you got an old desktop
and you hear it spin up,

96
00:04:46,499 --> 00:04:48,630
this is the thing that's spinning.

97
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,134
And it's the place that
your operating system lives,

98
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:54,364
your files live, your
applications live while they're

99
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:56,220
stored and while the
computer's turned off.

100
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,719
And then they're loaded into
this while they're running,

101
00:04:59,719 --> 00:05:00,636
and then...

102
00:05:07,162 --> 00:05:09,904
this CPU takes the data from

103
00:05:09,904 --> 00:05:12,571
the main memory and your program

104
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,527
runs at three billion
operations per second.

105
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,588
Let's talk a little bit
about something that,

106
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:23,921
this is probably from the 1960s or '70s.

107
00:05:24,963 --> 00:05:29,206
This actually has, if you're
an electrical person, it has

108
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:33,373
capacitors, those little
silver things are capacitors.

109
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:37,437
These little colored things are resisters,

110
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,540
and that's more capacitors,
and then there's wires,

111
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,597
and wires move everything.

112
00:05:41,597 --> 00:05:45,527
So when you say this has
millions of transistors,

113
00:05:45,527 --> 00:05:48,785
oh wait, that isn't a
capacitor, that's a transistor.

114
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:50,075
That's a transistor.

115
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:52,943
When you say that this here has etched,

116
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,325
and it you look closely at this,

117
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:56,642
go look at a picture of
a microprocessor online,

118
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:59,113
you will see that is
has millions of these.

119
00:05:59,113 --> 00:06:02,780
And so the difference
between 1960 and today

120
00:06:04,104 --> 00:06:06,771
is this circuitry of capacitors,

121
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:10,779
resistors, and transistors,

122
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:14,871
has been micro-ized and put onto this.

123
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,242
It's using a photographic process

124
00:06:17,242 --> 00:06:20,577
and they're tinier and tinier,
and putting more and more on.

125
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:23,150
And if you think going from millions

126
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,748
of these to one of these is crazy,

127
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:28,671
the thing that's happening now,

128
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,589
and the reason we have whole
computers inside our pocket,

129
00:06:31,589 --> 00:06:35,734
is that everything, all
of this, this whole thing,

130
00:06:35,734 --> 00:06:39,391
CPU, memory, everything,
all of it connected,

131
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:42,775
and the storage, is being
made smaller and smaller.

132
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,680
And so this little single-board computer

133
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,513
called a Raspberry Pi,
has one thing in it.

134
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:50,497
It has the main memory,
and it has the CPU,

135
00:06:50,497 --> 00:06:52,683
it has connections for
thing like peripherals

136
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,227
like keyboards and stuff.

137
00:06:54,227 --> 00:06:56,744
Now it doesn't yet have
secondary storage on it,

138
00:06:56,744 --> 00:07:00,919
the secondary storage gets
plugged in right here by a USB.

139
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:04,644
And then if you take it one
step farther to my phone,

140
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:08,868
it's got the secondary
storage built right in.

141
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:12,850
This picture goes from the size
of cabinets in the old days,

142
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,708
all the way down to really tiny.

143
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:19,232
But at the end of the
day, inside it is a highly

144
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:21,736
sophisticated piece of
circuitry that asks for

145
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:25,204
instructions one at a time and main memory

146
00:07:25,204 --> 00:07:29,039
that holds the instructions
and feeds them.

147
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,789
Central processor does the
thinking, take a look here.

148
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,168
Central processor does the
thinking, it run the program,

149
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:38,345
it's asking what's next,
it's not really smart,

150
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:39,607
but it's really fast.

151
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:43,289
And so we compensate for
the lack of intelligence

152
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:46,336
of this thing by us writing
really good software

153
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,597
that runs really fast.

154
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:50,476
And so voice recognition
on things like phones

155
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:53,727
is possible because computers
have so much storage

156
00:07:53,727 --> 00:07:56,376
and they run so fast
and the algorithms that

157
00:07:56,376 --> 00:08:00,442
do voice recognition are
finally starting to work.

158
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:03,625
Input devices like
keyboards and mice and pens

159
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:05,627
and whatever, they come in.

160
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:08,360
Output devices are like
the screens that we see.

161
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,230
The main memory is the
fast part of the computer

162
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,865
that stores all the programs.

163
00:08:12,865 --> 00:08:16,297
And the secondary memory
is the permanent storage.

164
00:08:16,297 --> 00:08:19,047
Increasingly, secondary memory...

165
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:22,719
Do I have any USB sticks in here?

166
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:23,958
I don't.

167
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:28,041
Well, increasingly secondary
memory is flash RAM,

168
00:08:28,965 --> 00:08:30,048
or static RAM

169
00:08:31,648 --> 00:08:33,398
with no moving parts.

170
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:36,987
In a few years you'll
not even be able to see

171
00:08:36,987 --> 00:08:39,866
secondary memory with moving parts.

172
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,155
But that's okay, it's
still secondary memory,

173
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,572
it's still memory that lasts.

174
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:48,584
And so you and where
your place is in here,

175
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:50,901
is you live in the main
memory, this is you.

176
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:52,349
You are here.

177
00:08:52,349 --> 00:08:55,658
And so in a sense, when
the CPU asks the question,

178
00:08:55,658 --> 00:08:58,124
what next? It is your job to answer that.

179
00:08:58,124 --> 00:09:00,920
And you answer that by
writing Python code.

180
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,751
So your Python code, you'll
write a file in Python code,

181
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,619
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

182
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:08,838
And then that Python code sort
of gets loaded in the main

183
00:09:08,838 --> 00:09:11,594
memory, there's a magic
translation process that happens.

184
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:15,093
And then your code is actually
answering this question

185
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:16,693
three billion times a second.

186
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:18,985
Three billion times a
second, you're sitting there,

187
00:09:18,985 --> 00:09:22,594
but this is you, you're really
out here, but you then write

188
00:09:22,594 --> 00:09:25,561
a file and the file's loaded
in and then the files runs.

189
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:27,589
And that's how things are at.

190
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:30,528
And that's your place in the world.

191
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:33,651
What's actually running
is not Python code,

192
00:09:33,651 --> 00:09:36,349
there is, as I said,
a translation process.

193
00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:40,668
You write a Python file, and
then Python itself translates

194
00:09:40,668 --> 00:09:44,835
this into the actual language
known by the micro processor.

195
00:09:45,902 --> 00:09:48,379
Which is a series of zeros and
ones called machine language.

196
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,855
Some day I would love
to teach you a class on

197
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,665
machine language, but for now
we're gonna teach you Python

198
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:55,435
and we're gonna use Python as a crutch,

199
00:09:55,435 --> 00:09:58,125
we don't have to talk machine
language, but you could.

200
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,488
If you really wanted to,
you could know how to write

201
00:10:00,488 --> 00:10:02,812
machine language but
I assure you Python is

202
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:06,206
far easier to learn than machine language.

203
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:09,317
So Python acts as a translator,
translates what you're

204
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,781
doing into machine language,
and then the machine language

205
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:14,111
is what's sent back and forth.

206
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:16,187
But still, even though it's
translated to machine language,

207
00:10:16,187 --> 00:10:19,311
it's you, it is you
answering those questions.

208
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:22,088
And that's what a program
is, is you pre-storing

209
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,692
your response to the what next question

210
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:27,154
over and over again.

211
00:10:27,154 --> 00:10:28,555
So here's a couple of videos that

212
00:10:28,555 --> 00:10:31,527
you can look at on YouTube about a CPU.

213
00:10:31,527 --> 00:10:33,426
These CPUs, and it looks very much

214
00:10:33,426 --> 00:10:36,656
like this CPU that I've got with me,

215
00:10:36,656 --> 00:10:39,573
these CPUs run extremely high heat.

216
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:43,470
When you put your computer on your lap

217
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,434
and it starts to heat up, that means it's

218
00:10:45,434 --> 00:10:47,443
thinking really, really hard.

219
00:10:47,443 --> 00:10:50,268
And so this is a small little old video

220
00:10:50,268 --> 00:10:52,843
from a long time ago that
shows what happens when you

221
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:56,728
you take out the cooling
capability of microprocessors,

222
00:10:56,728 --> 00:10:59,091
and just how hot they can be.

223
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,971
And the other video that
I have is a hard disk,

224
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:06,084
something like this hard disk that I have,

225
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:09,105
except that it works and
they turn the power on.

226
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:11,458
Some of them last for a few seconds,

227
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:15,123
some of them last for a few minutes.

228
00:11:15,123 --> 00:11:17,373
(sneezing)

229
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:22,252
I must be allergic to this hard drive,

230
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:24,630
or maybe it's 'cause there's
dust in the hard drive

231
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,630
and I keep spinning it and I sneeze.

232
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:31,890
But basically, some of them
last for a few seconds,

233
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:33,398
some of them last for a few minutes.

234
00:11:33,398 --> 00:11:35,062
It's not a good idea to open them up,

235
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:36,938
but I'm glad somebody
opened it up and then

236
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:39,288
did what they did and
then recorded it so we

237
00:11:39,288 --> 00:11:44,035
can all enjoy what it is that
they're capable of doing.

238
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,887
So that's a quick
introduction to hardware,

239
00:11:46,887 --> 00:11:50,338
mostly so that I can use
those words going forward.

240
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:53,421
What we're gonna talk
about next is communicating

241
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,393
in the language Python,
that is writing code and

242
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:59,227
putting it into the computer
so that that can execute,

243
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:00,060
okay?
