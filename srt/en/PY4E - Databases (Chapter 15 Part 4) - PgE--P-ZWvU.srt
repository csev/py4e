1
00:00:00,838 --> 00:00:02,888
- Now we're going to
represent these relationships

2
00:00:02,888 --> 00:00:05,555
in the database, and again,
what we're trying to solve

3
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:08,299
here is this notion of
database normalization.

4
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:11,550
Third normal form, there's
so much theory, right?

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,473
But, in this lecture, I'm
just gonna condense this

6
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:18,324
down to, don't replicate
string data and use,

7
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:19,564
what are called, keys.

8
00:00:19,564 --> 00:00:22,222
Use integer keys to point at those things,

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,842
and we're going to use these
integers then to point.

10
00:00:24,842 --> 00:00:27,285
So, assign each row an
integer, and then we're going

11
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:29,762
to point from one row to
another, using those integers.

12
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:33,054
And so we're gonna add
these special key columns to

13
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:35,428
each of the tables and help,
and the database will even

14
00:00:35,428 --> 00:00:37,985
give us help managing those.

15
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:41,345
Now, and so we still need to keep track of

16
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:43,672
who is the creator of the album,

17
00:00:43,672 --> 00:00:45,143
which album a track belongs to,

18
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:47,608
we've gotta create these relationships

19
00:00:47,608 --> 00:00:49,123
and we have to come up with ways to store

20
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:50,740
those relationships.

21
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,155
And so, the idea is, is
we're going to have a column,

22
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,296
in a table which is the key column,

23
00:00:56,296 --> 00:00:58,361
and we're going to call
this the ID column.

24
00:00:58,361 --> 00:01:00,537
So this is a row, it might
have many bits of data here,

25
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:02,970
but in this case it's just
the name of an artist.

26
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,156
So this album is going
to belong to an artist.

27
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:08,872
And we're going to assign a
number, inside the database,

28
00:01:08,872 --> 00:01:12,991
so that Led Zepplin is
one, and AC/DC is two,

29
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,147
and so we have this key,
this is called a primary key,

30
00:01:16,147 --> 00:01:19,191
and then later, when we want
to say that the Who Made Who

31
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:24,809
album really was done by AC/DC,
we put the number two in.

32
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:29,571
So the difference here is,
instead of saying AC/DC in this

33
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:31,005
record, we just put the number two,

34
00:01:31,005 --> 00:01:32,889
once we've established this number.

35
00:01:32,889 --> 00:01:35,908
So we assign keys, and then
we have these pointers that

36
00:01:35,908 --> 00:01:39,092
point back and so that's
how we model a relationship,

37
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:42,409
with these small integer numbers.

38
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,848
And so there are three basic
kind of keys that we use.

39
00:01:44,848 --> 00:01:48,292
One is the primary key and
that is that little ID column

40
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:51,108
that is just a number, but
once we give Led Zepplin the

41
00:01:51,108 --> 00:01:54,435
number one, Led Zepplin
has got the key one for the

42
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:57,337
rest of that database.

43
00:01:57,337 --> 00:02:00,475
The logical key is the
text area that we use that

44
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:02,998
you might lookup, so
the title of the band,

45
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:03,973
or the title of the album,

46
00:02:03,973 --> 00:02:05,295
that's the logical key.

47
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:06,979
And then the foreign
key is one of these keys

48
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:09,354
that is really pointing
to the primary key of

49
00:02:09,354 --> 00:02:13,249
another row. That's called a foreign key.

50
00:02:13,249 --> 00:02:16,445
You might think that you
want to use something

51
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:18,533
like an email address
as the primary key for

52
00:02:18,533 --> 00:02:20,354
a user table or something like that.

53
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:22,745
The logical key should
always be separate and

54
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:24,336
there should always be a primary key,

55
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:25,569
that integer number.

56
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,261
Cause things like logical keys do change.

57
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:28,882
People do get new email addresses,

58
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,822
and if you've got that email address as a

59
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:33,510
foreign key pointing all over the place,

60
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,417
it doesn't work out so well.

61
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:37,339
So that's why you use
these small integer numbers

62
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:39,149
that have no meaning outside.

63
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:40,899
So sometimes if you're
on a system and you see

64
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:44,986
a URL and you see some
number like 422,016,

65
00:02:44,986 --> 00:02:46,130
you're like, oh, that
turns out to probably be

66
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,443
my primary key in their database.

67
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,707
So, sometimes you can look at a URL and

68
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:52,896
you can see these primary keys in the URL,

69
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:54,966
but they don't mean
anything outside of that

70
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,380
particular system.

71
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,525
So, like I said, a foreign
key is the key that

72
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:02,207
is really pointing at a
row in a different table.

73
00:03:02,207 --> 00:03:05,857
So, we have album has
a primary key for it,

74
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:09,514
but the artist_id points
to a row in the artist

75
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:12,405
table, as we will soon see.

76
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:15,646
I have a naming convention,
and in my naming convention

77
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:18,922
on this lecture, I use id
for the primary key and then

78
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:22,626
Artist_id I use uppercase
for the table names,

79
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:27,180
and then Artist_id says
this is a key this is just a

80
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,720
key that points to the id
key of the artist table.

81
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,818
And so that's what I do,
so you'll see, in all my

82
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:33,753
stuff I'll use that.

83
00:03:33,753 --> 00:03:37,857
It's a convention, it's not
something SQL forces you to do,

84
00:03:37,857 --> 00:03:40,093
but you will find when
you go to organizations

85
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:42,027
and work on their databases,
these conventions are

86
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:44,382
very important so I can
do something and you can

87
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:47,580
understand the rules
in which I created it.

88
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,982
Some of these, you'll find
this used by some people,

89
00:03:49,982 --> 00:03:51,793
you'll find completely
different conventions,

90
00:03:51,793 --> 00:03:52,688
and that will be okay.

91
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:54,978
Whatever convention
your organization uses,

92
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:57,328
learn that convention.

93
00:03:57,328 --> 00:04:00,682
So now we're going to talk
about how we put these keys in,

94
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:03,564
and then how we actually
make the connections

95
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:05,152
from one row to another row.
