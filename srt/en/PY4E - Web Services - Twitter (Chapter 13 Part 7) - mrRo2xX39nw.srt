1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:02,366
Now we're gonna talk
about API rate limiting

2
00:00:02,366 --> 00:00:06,453
and security, the key thing
is that the Google API

3
00:00:06,453 --> 00:00:09,271
and the Google data is super valuable.

4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:10,734
And you could build a
website that did nothing

5
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:13,334
but sort of like asked
the person for something

6
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:14,940
and then showed them that place

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,714
and make them be a map searcher.

8
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:18,241
And you added so little value and

9
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:20,303
Google did all the hard work.

10
00:00:20,303 --> 00:00:22,538
And so they protect these somewhat.

11
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:23,940
Sometimes, they'll say you can only do 50

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,208
of these a day or 500 a day or whatever.

13
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,206
That's called rate
limiting, and sometimes they

14
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:30,827
say you've got to login, you've

15
00:00:30,827 --> 00:00:33,359
got to create an account
and get a key with us.

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:34,676
And then present your key so that means

17
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:36,889
that your account only gets so many.

18
00:00:36,889 --> 00:00:38,791
And they keep track of
whose using their service

19
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:40,846
and how much they're using it.

20
00:00:40,846 --> 00:00:42,621
Google gives you even sort of a dashboard

21
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:46,491
that tells you some of this
stuff, it's kinda nice.

22
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:51,401
And so, the other thing
is that sometimes and API

23
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:53,381
is free and then it becomes popular

24
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:55,007
and they decide they're gonna put a key

25
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,581
on it or a rate limit on it.

26
00:00:56,581 --> 00:00:58,724
So you gotta kinda play
this game with them.

27
00:00:58,724 --> 00:01:02,302
And the rules kinda
change as things progress.

28
00:01:02,302 --> 00:01:05,206
So that geo coding API
that we were talking about

29
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:10,029
has at one point in time
2,500 requests a day.

30
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:13,598
You can get more request if you get a key.

31
00:01:13,598 --> 00:01:15,627
Now, another API that we can talk

32
00:01:15,627 --> 00:01:18,129
about, is the Twitter API, now Twitter API

33
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:20,945
started out as a free public API.

34
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:22,439
But then Twitter realized that people are

35
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,835
making more money off of
Twitter's data than Twitter

36
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,173
was making off of Twitter's data.

37
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:29,016
And so Twitter makes is so
that you have to have an

38
00:01:29,016 --> 00:01:32,660
account, you can only
request data from their API

39
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,922
if you use your account key to sign that.

40
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,910
And so, there's a whole series of getting

41
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,136
and issuing keys and
then using those keys.

42
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:45,048
And I'll just give you
a short summary of the

43
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:47,112
kinda code that it takes to build those

44
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:52,405
requests up that have to be signed.

45
00:01:52,405 --> 00:01:55,527
So you'll look through
the Twitter documentation

46
00:01:55,527 --> 00:02:00,123
and it'll say oh, this url
to get the tweets, etc., etc.

47
00:02:00,123 --> 00:02:02,838
And it says do a get request to this url

48
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:04,656
and that url and maybe
substitute a little bit

49
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:06,576
of things here for the screen name you're

50
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:09,179
looking for or how many tweets you want.

51
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,565
And they tell you how to
carefully construct these urls.

52
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:16,217
And so here's an example
bit of code that talks

53
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:21,441
to the Twitter, for now I'll
ignore the security bit.

54
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,912
And that's all hidden in this twurl, so

55
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:26,233
it looks a lot like the last
one, we're gonna use json

56
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:30,561
and urllib and we have found
that this is the API name,

57
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:32,978
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, list.json.

58
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:35,975
Getting a friend list
for a particular person.

59
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:40,421
And so that is the base
url that we're going to do.

60
00:02:40,421 --> 00:02:44,233
And we're going to ask a
person for a Twitter account.

61
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:45,980
If we hit enter, we're gonna break out.

62
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,276
And twurl augment, we're
gonna say give me the

63
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:51,497
first five friends of this
particular screen name,

64
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,639
the one we just read in from input.

65
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:56,372
And this twurl, you'll
see in a second, it adds

66
00:02:56,372 --> 00:02:59,675
a bunch of stuff to prove
that you are who you are.

67
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:02,764
It's signing that url, so
you're sending a signed url.

68
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:04,590
Which is nothing more
than a whole bunch of

69
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,060
crazy characters, we'll
see that in a second.

70
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,694
We retrieve it and this is
pretty straight forward.

71
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:13,959
We can just, you know, open
the url, read it and decode it.

72
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,342
Decode solves the utf8
thing, makes it all so that

73
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:20,410
data is a real string and it's
in the Unicode internally.

74
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,198
Now we can actually get the headers.

75
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:26,659
Remember I told you earlier
that url open bypasses

76
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:28,946
the headers, but it stored them for later.

77
00:03:28,946 --> 00:03:30,262
We can say hey, give
me back those headers.

78
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:33,618
And it gives us back a
dictionary of headers.

79
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:35,365
And the headers if you
go all the way back,

80
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:38,911
are a bunch of key value pairs.

81
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:42,371
Key:value in the headers
and in Twitter, if you

82
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:45,357
read the documentation, there's
this x-rate-limit-remaining

83
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:48,205
that tells you each time
it returns to the API,

84
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:50,865
response to the API call that you made.

85
00:03:50,865 --> 00:03:53,026
It says, look, you've got
12 left, you've got 11 left,

86
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:55,886
you've got 10 so you can print that out.

87
00:03:55,886 --> 00:03:58,407
So this prints out how
many you've got left.

88
00:03:58,407 --> 00:04:00,860
Then we parse the json data.

89
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,325
We're gonna print it so we can debug it.

90
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:07,042
This dumps, dump to
string and then print it.

91
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,920
Indent=4, this is called pretty printing

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,662
and it's indenting things really nicely

93
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:15,492
so that you can make more sense of it.

94
00:04:15,492 --> 00:04:17,512
Whereas when these things
are talking, when programs

95
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:19,307
are talking to each
other, they don't really

96
00:04:19,307 --> 00:04:24,164
make the output look particularly pretty.

97
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:27,585
And then if you, we're
gonna go through and we have

98
00:04:27,585 --> 00:04:30,178
the outer thing of users
and we're gonna print out

99
00:04:30,178 --> 00:04:34,341
the screen name and go grab
for each user and users,

100
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,650
we're gonna print their
screen name, we're gonna

101
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,491
grab their status text and print that out.

102
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:41,756
And so this is what that data looks like.

103
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:44,680
Kinda chopped a bit,
so the thing we get is

104
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,244
an outer layer, we get users
and then we get a list.

105
00:04:51,244 --> 00:04:53,045
And here's the first user,
now if you look at the

106
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:55,184
actual data, it's much larger than this.

107
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:58,226
Here's a second user and
then we have status text,

108
00:04:58,226 --> 00:05:02,493
status text and the screen name, right.

109
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:05,668
And so those are the bits that
we're extracting from that.

110
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:08,145
If you look, we are going
to grab the screen name,

111
00:05:08,145 --> 00:05:10,472
we're gonna grab the status
text and away you go.

112
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:17,185
So, you can start with
this, but you realize

113
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:19,289
that once you're looking
at this and you're printing

114
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:21,046
this out with pretty
printing, you can sort of

115
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:22,916
work you way in knowing that it's

116
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:25,399
either a dictionary or a list.

117
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:26,998
Cause the dictionary you look up the key.

118
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:29,354
If it's a list, you say
which position it is.

119
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,561
And then you get more
dictionaries within dictionaries

120
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:33,440
within dictionaries and away you go.

121
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,099
And so this code, actually,
you know, when it runs,

122
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:39,876
it prints out the screen
name and then that status.

123
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:42,643
And then the next person
so it's my first five.

124
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,419
In that case, my first
five friends and their

125
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:48,751
most recent status, the first five people.

126
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:52,245
Now, let's talk a little bit
about how the security works.

127
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:54,264
And so you have to go to the website,

128
00:05:54,264 --> 00:05:55,920
you have to have a Twitter account.

129
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,746
You can't talk to Twitter API
without a Twitter account.

130
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:03,108
And then you go to this website
and then you set up a key.

131
00:06:03,108 --> 00:06:06,049
You say, I'm going to build
an application that is

132
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:08,350
gonna consume the Twitter API.

133
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,272
And then you go in, you
have to work through.

134
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,833
There's documentation on
how all this stuff works.

135
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,957
You set up an API key,
you set the application.

136
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:19,595
So I made a key called
python on my laptop.

137
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:22,204
And it gives us some values,
it gives us a consumer

138
00:06:22,204 --> 00:06:25,901
key, a consumer secret, a
token key, and token secret.

139
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:27,318
And you get to regenerate these.

140
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:30,743
And there's this file called hidden.py.

141
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:33,032
And you edit them and copy
and paste all the stuff

142
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:38,328
from those pages, those four
values into these strings.

143
00:06:38,328 --> 00:06:41,038
Now, if you download my
code, I don't have my keys

144
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:43,680
in there, I've got some
place holders for this stuff.

145
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,042
So you've gotta get to this
webpage that's on Twitter,

146
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:49,620
copy these things in and then

147
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,310
the twurl code will start to work.

148
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,346
It uses a technology
called OAuth which is a way

149
00:06:56,346 --> 00:07:00,766
to sign a url in a way
that proves you have

150
00:07:00,766 --> 00:07:04,388
the key and a secret and the tokens

151
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:06,977
and it can't be modified in the middle.

152
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:09,200
So once you send this url, they can check

153
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,815
the key and the secret to make sure that

154
00:07:10,815 --> 00:07:12,377
you've truly signed it without

155
00:07:12,377 --> 00:07:14,403
actually sending the key and the secret.

156
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:16,179
It's actually kinda cool and fascinating.

157
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:17,755
But we won't go into it
in great detail here.

158
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:24,396
And so if you look at
the code in twurl.py,

159
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:25,877
this is the code that does it.

160
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:28,469
It actually pulls in an OAuth library,

161
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:33,358
that hidden.py, that is
that code that you've got.

162
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:37,473
And it's got the consumer
key, the consumer secret,

163
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:42,915
secrets, and this is
pulling that from hidden.py.

164
00:07:42,915 --> 00:07:46,138
This is a lot of stuff that's
using this OAuth library.

165
00:07:46,138 --> 00:07:47,859
Don't worry too much about that.

166
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:49,466
Eventually, it produces a
url that looks like this.

167
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:52,045
And what happens is, this is the base url

168
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:55,091
you were told to use,
then you have count=2

169
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:57,553
and screen_name=drchuck,
those parts are your

170
00:07:57,553 --> 00:08:01,931
parameters to that web service call.

171
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:05,327
And then all this OAuth stuff is produced

172
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:10,216
by this OAuth code and the
consumer key and the secret.

173
00:08:10,216 --> 00:08:13,027
What happens is a key gets
sent, the key gets sent

174
00:08:13,027 --> 00:08:16,881
and the secret does not get sent.

175
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:20,047
But they send this signature
which is based on the secret.

176
00:08:20,047 --> 00:08:22,452
And then what it does is
it rechecks the signature

177
00:08:22,452 --> 00:08:25,017
on the far end, signature's a long string.

178
00:08:25,017 --> 00:08:28,248
By regenerating the
signature because the secrets

179
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:32,171
aren't available to both you
to generate the signature

180
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:33,849
and to them to check the signature.

181
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,065
So it's kinda like a hash, etc., etc.

182
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:38,503
You don't have to worry about all this.

183
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:41,549
These urls get really long and your values

184
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,235
that you need are in,
the name of the url's in.

185
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:46,781
And you call this routine,
that's called augment,

186
00:08:46,781 --> 00:08:48,545
that takes a url and then parameters

187
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:51,608
and then augments it by
adding all this OAuth stuff.

188
00:08:51,608 --> 00:08:55,346
And so that's why it's called
augment, to augment the url.

189
00:08:55,346 --> 00:08:57,095
And once you've got this
set up and hidden working,

190
00:08:57,095 --> 00:09:01,014
then you sort of just augment
the url and then hit it.

191
00:09:01,014 --> 00:09:03,118
Now, you know, if you
don't have the right keys

192
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:04,778
or secrets or you don't
have an account on Twitter,

193
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,036
then it's gonna blow up,
but if you get it set up,

194
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:11,066
you will be able to talk to
the Twitter API with this.

195
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:13,082
So this whole web services section,

196
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:15,604
we've done quite a bit of stuff right.

197
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:20,046
We've looked at how instead
of reading html or flat text,

198
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:23,471
we are creating structured data according

199
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:26,176
to contracts whether it be xml or json.

200
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:28,202
We can retrieve and
parse that information in

201
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:30,407
a deterministic way,
we talked about schemas

202
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:34,248
that define the contracts
so that you know if the

203
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:36,163
data you're getting is
wrong, you know who to blame

204
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:38,661
because the schema gets violated.

205
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,643
And we've played with
APIs, where you're talking

206
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:44,502
to someone else, whose
defining what the rules are

207
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,706
and how to read their documentation.

208
00:09:46,706 --> 00:09:49,504
And even if they have an API key or need

209
00:09:49,504 --> 00:09:55,384
signed urls, showed a little
bit about how to do that.
