1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:01,336
- Now I'm gonna talk a little bit about

2
00:00:01,336 --> 00:00:03,781
object lifecycle and what
we mean by object lifecycle

3
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:06,712
is the act of creating and
destroying these objects.

4
00:00:06,712 --> 00:00:10,009
Now I've been using this
term constructor already.

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:13,184
And so, when we declare a variable,

6
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:14,745
whether it's a string or a dictionary

7
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,881
or a party animal we create them

8
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:18,889
and then they're discarded,
and there's all this

9
00:00:18,889 --> 00:00:21,163
dynamic memory that comes and goes.

10
00:00:21,163 --> 00:00:24,791
And we as the writers of
objects have the ability

11
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,316
to insert ourselves at the
moment of object creation

12
00:00:28,316 --> 00:00:30,096
and at the moment of object destruction

13
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:33,952
and we make special functions
that we call the constructor,

14
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:36,426
the object constructor
or the class constructor,

15
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:37,745
and the destructor.

16
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:40,165
And we don't actually
explicitly call them,

17
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,776
they're called automatically by the,

18
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,744
by Python on our behalf.

19
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,980
And so the constructor is
much more commonly used.

20
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,407
It's used to set up any initial

21
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:51,793
values of variables if necessary.

22
00:00:51,793 --> 00:00:52,933
Et cetera, et cetera.

23
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,077
Destructors, we'll cover them but

24
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:59,054
they're used very rarely.

25
00:00:59,054 --> 00:01:00,876
So here's a bit of code that we've got.

26
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:03,074
It's our PartyAnimal and
a lot of it is the same

27
00:01:03,074 --> 00:01:05,941
as what we've been doing so far.

28
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,626
So we have this variable x.

29
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:12,845
And the constructor has
a special name, __init_.

30
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:16,779
Again we pass in the
instance of the object self,

31
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:17,906
and in this one all we're gonna do

32
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:20,117
is print out your constructed.

33
00:01:20,117 --> 00:01:22,069
And here's this code that we've had before

34
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:25,647
and now we have __del
and then we pass in self

35
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:28,306
and we'll just print out
that we're being destructed

36
00:01:28,306 --> 00:01:31,166
and what the current value of x is

37
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:35,752
for that particular instance.

38
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,256
So let's go ahead and run this.

39
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:41,134
Um, and so again this
doesn't really do any code

40
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,275
up to here, that just defines PartyAnimal

41
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:45,482
but this is the constructing of it.

42
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:47,263
And basically that says, oh!

43
00:01:47,263 --> 00:01:49,143
And it really kind of
creates these variables

44
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:51,605
and then it also runs the constructor.

45
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:54,661
And so in this case, this line right here

46
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,836
is causing the I am constructed
message to come out.

47
00:01:57,836 --> 00:02:02,313
Then we do, an.party
an.party and that says,

48
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:03,788
you know, one and two.

49
00:02:03,788 --> 00:02:05,167
And here's an interesting thing,

50
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,346
we're actually gonna destroy this variable

51
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:12,071
by throwing away, an no
longer points at that object.

52
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:14,211
an's gonna point to 42
so we're gonna sort of

53
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:18,306
overwrite an and put 42
in it, and at that point,

54
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,487
Python's like, oh, this whole
little object that I just

55
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:24,720
created somewhere it's out
here, it's vaporizing it

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,420
and throwing it away, and so,
before this line completes,

57
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,180
it actually calls our
destructor on our behalf,

58
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,059
and so that message comes out.

59
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:37,478
So we are allowed as the
builder of these objects

60
00:02:37,478 --> 00:02:39,547
to add these little
chunks of code that says

61
00:02:39,547 --> 00:02:42,592
I wanna be involved at the
moment this object is created

62
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,014
and I wanna be involved at the moment

63
00:02:44,014 --> 00:02:46,553
that this object is destroyed.

64
00:02:46,553 --> 00:02:50,643
Now, in this last line, an
is no longer a party animal,

65
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:52,995
an is now an integer.

66
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:54,432
It's got a 42 in it.

67
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,536
It's gone, it's been created, it was used

68
00:02:56,536 --> 00:02:58,481
and then it was destroyed, okay?

69
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:00,210
So you gotta be careful if
you overwrite something,

70
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,886
you could sorta throw the object away.

71
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:06,785
So the constructor is
the special block of code

72
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,799
that's called when the object is created

73
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,839
to set the object up.

74
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,864
So we can create lots of instances,

75
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:17,594
everything we've done so
far is we make a class

76
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:20,389
and then we create one
instance, one object.

77
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:23,436
And each of these objects ends
up being stored in its own

78
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:26,056
variable, we have a variable
an and we've been using it.

79
00:03:26,056 --> 00:03:27,973
But the more interesting
thing begins to happen

80
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:31,494
when we have multiple
instances of the same class

81
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:33,636
sitting in different variables.

82
00:03:33,636 --> 00:03:36,327
And it has its own copy
of the instance variables.

83
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:38,536
So let's take a look at this.

84
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:44,073
So, this code here, I've
taken out the destructor.

85
00:03:44,073 --> 00:03:46,407
And it shows a little
bit more information.

86
00:03:46,407 --> 00:03:48,151
So now we're gonna put
two variables in here,

87
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:50,747
we're gonna have a
current score or whatever.

88
00:03:50,747 --> 00:03:51,686
And a name.

89
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:53,426
And we're gonna start it out as blank.

90
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:56,702
And this time we're
going to add a parameter

91
00:03:56,702 --> 00:03:58,227
onto the constructor.

92
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:00,844
And so the self comes in
sort of automatically,

93
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:03,134
as the object is being constructed,

94
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:06,087
but if we put a parameter
on the constructor call

95
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:09,354
which is this PartyAnimal
call, then this comes in

96
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:11,236
as the z variable.

97
00:04:11,236 --> 00:04:14,967
And so self is the object itself, and z,

98
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,478
this first parameter is
whatever parameter we put here.

99
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:19,334
Everything we've done so
far has no parameter here,

100
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:21,310
but now we have a parameter here.

101
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,889
And then, that means that
when we call this constructor,

102
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,831
this line of code comes and
then name is no longer blank,

103
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:31,655
name is gonna be Sally
in this particular thing.

104
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:34,280
And then it'll say, oh,
self.name, which'll be Sally,

105
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,838
has been constructed.

106
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:39,402
And so then, then we have
this, and that object

107
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:42,545
is now constructed in and
we put it in the variable s.

108
00:04:42,545 --> 00:04:44,418
And then we call the party method on that,

109
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,037
and we construct a different one and so

110
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:49,831
this time it calls and z is Jim.

111
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,969
And we basically have a...

112
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:54,988
Oops.

113
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:56,674
Another copy of this.

114
00:04:56,674 --> 00:04:59,050
And so, this is how it's going to look.

115
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,829
Right, as it runs down here.

116
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:04,475
As it runs down here,

117
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:08,447
when this is called, it makes one instance

118
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:10,534
and stores that in the variable s.

119
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,139
And there's a variable x in there,

120
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:14,707
there's a name in there,
there's an init method in party

121
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:17,154
and that's all in here, right,
all that stuff is in here.

122
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:19,200
And now we say, let's make, and that's

123
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,194
gonna have a Sally in there.

124
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:26,555
Alright, Sally in there.

125
00:05:26,555 --> 00:05:28,785
And then we're gonna
do another constructor

126
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:30,395
and so it's gonna make a whole new thing

127
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,338
and it's gonna store that in j,

128
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:35,457
and this one's gonna have Jim in it.

129
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:37,379
s.party then this turns into
a one and then we're gonna

130
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,599
call j.party, that turns that into a one

131
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,651
and then s.party will
cause this to be a two.

132
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:45,900
Okay, and so what happens is,

133
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,154
we have now two objects,

134
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:52,027
one in the variable s and
one in the variable j,

135
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:54,911
and they have separate copies
of their instance variables.

136
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:57,730
These are the instance
variables or the object fields

137
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,002
or whatever but they're the variables.

138
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:01,728
But the key is, is that every time we

139
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:05,039
do a new construction, it duplicates this

140
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,587
and there's another copy of it.

141
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:08,592
So there's an x within s.

142
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:13,846
So s.x is this variable and j.x

143
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:15,551
is that variable.

144
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,470
Okay?

145
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,786
So the next thing we'll
talk about is inheritance

146
00:06:19,786 --> 00:06:22,751
and that's the idea of taking one class

147
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:25,284
and extending it to make something new.
