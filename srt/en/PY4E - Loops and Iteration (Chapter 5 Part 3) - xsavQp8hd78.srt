1
00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:02,321
- So now we're gonna
talk about Loop Idioms.

2
00:00:02,321 --> 00:00:06,153
Loop Idioms are patterns that have to do

3
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:07,781
with how we construct loops.

4
00:00:07,781 --> 00:00:11,394
We have the mechanics
of "fors" and "whiles",

5
00:00:11,394 --> 00:00:14,074
but ultimately we want
to get something done.

6
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:16,230
We want to solve a problem with a loop.

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,141
And often what we have to do is,

8
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:19,773
if we have a set of things,

9
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:22,951
whether it's lines or strings
or characters or numbers,

10
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:25,590
we're looking for something
like the largest or the smallest

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,270
or we want to add them up
or something like that.

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,070
So we can't just say, "Add 'em up",

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,401
we have to say, "Go through each one

14
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:34,959
"and do something to each one."

15
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:37,239
And somehow achieve adding them up.

16
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,270
The pattern that we're going to follow is

17
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,122
we're going to have this loop that gonna

18
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:46,935
run once for each thing
in some chunk of data.

19
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:49,132
We're gonna set something at the beginning

20
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,845
and then we're going to
do something to each one.

21
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:53,169
And then at the end we're
gonna get the payoff.

22
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:54,548
We're gonna get the result.

23
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:57,646
So if we're summing things,

24
00:00:57,646 --> 00:00:59,761
we're going to have a running total.

25
00:00:59,761 --> 00:01:02,277
This will be like T equals zero.

26
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:07,532
And then this will be T
equals T plus the thing value.

27
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:08,811
But this is not the real total.

28
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:10,848
It's the running total during the loop,

29
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:13,700
but at the end it is the real total.

30
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,924
So we're going to look at what you do

31
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:17,880
before the loop starts, during the loop,

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,407
and then what you get after the loop

33
00:01:20,407 --> 00:01:23,818
and how you can use that.

34
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:24,651
We're gonna use this loop.

35
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:25,747
It's just going to loop through

36
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:29,660
a set of six numbers over
and over and over again.

37
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,892
We're going to do
something before the loop,

38
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:31,955
we're going to do
something after the loop,

39
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:34,438
and we're going to run the
loop some number of times.

40
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:36,877
In this case "thing" is
our iteration variable

41
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:40,619
because I'm using
unpneumonic variables now.

42
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,283
It's gonna run 9, 41, 12, 3, 74, and 15.

43
00:01:45,283 --> 00:01:47,271
It's going to run and
print these things out.

44
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:49,708
It runs its loop six times and away we go.

45
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:52,475
Now this loop does nothing
except print stuff out.

46
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:53,941
Of course, I like to do that first.

47
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:55,887
I always print things out

48
00:01:55,887 --> 00:02:00,270
to make sure that my brain is functioning.

49
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:05,721
So, to understand how these loops work

50
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:08,527
I'm gonna ask you to
function as a program.

51
00:02:08,527 --> 00:02:11,214
I'm gonna show you some
numbers in succession

52
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,795
and I want you to mentally figure out

53
00:02:14,795 --> 00:02:16,055
what the largest number is.

54
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:17,736
But more importantly, think about how

55
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:19,569
your brain is solving this problem

56
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:21,041
of what is the largest number,

57
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,990
given that I'm only
going to show them to you

58
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,337
one at a time for a little while.

59
00:02:24,337 --> 00:02:25,558
You brain has to do something.

60
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:28,255
Imagine I was going to show
you thousands of numbers.

61
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:29,928
I'm not, but imagine I was.

62
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:32,905
How would you organize
yourself in a way so that

63
00:02:32,905 --> 00:02:35,221
for an hour and a half you could sit here

64
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,703
as I showed you numbers
and you'd keep track

65
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:41,775
of the largest number that
you've seen of all the numbers?

66
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,078
Okay, here we go.

67
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:48,113
Here's your first number.

68
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:51,598
Second number.

69
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,078
Third number.

70
00:02:54,078 --> 00:02:56,725
Fourth number.

71
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:58,775
Fifth number.

72
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:01,341
Sixth and last number.

73
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:06,901
What was the largest number?

74
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:08,299
What was it?

75
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:11,238
Well, it wasn't too hard.

76
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:13,318
It was 74.

77
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,148
But that's not the question.

78
00:03:15,148 --> 00:03:19,616
How did you brain arrive at 74?

79
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,046
Here's all the numbers.

80
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:22,998
If I was showing you all the numbers

81
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:25,726
and asked you, "What's
the largest number?"

82
00:03:25,726 --> 00:03:27,351
you're eyes would have sort of gone

83
00:03:27,351 --> 00:03:29,386
(zooming of eyes moving around the screen)

84
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:31,455
and then you'd got to 74.

85
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:34,058
You wouldn't do it in
any particular order.

86
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:36,456
Your eyes would just see the 74

87
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:38,736
and it would just throw
the smaller numbers away

88
00:03:38,736 --> 00:03:41,180
and it would move really
quickly to what the answer is.

89
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:44,309
Even if there was several
hundred numbers on the screen

90
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:47,326
your mind would sort of move fluidly

91
00:03:47,326 --> 00:03:50,336
wherever it felt like moving
and then arrive at it.

92
00:03:50,336 --> 00:03:51,963
Probably what it would do is

93
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:55,259
it would do something like move like this,

94
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,109
find this, and then check
to make sure that it's okay.

95
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,390
Then say, "Okay, I got 74.

96
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,487
"I'm done."

97
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:03,565
That's not how computers do it.

98
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:05,595
That is not how computers do it.

99
00:04:05,595 --> 00:04:07,383
They do not move fluidly.

100
00:04:07,383 --> 00:04:09,904
But they are highly dedicated.

101
00:04:09,904 --> 00:04:11,653
They're gonna do something.

102
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:13,927
(buzzing imitating a computer)

103
00:04:13,927 --> 00:04:14,937
(clicking)

104
00:04:14,937 --> 00:04:17,182
74.

105
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:19,673
But how would you construct
a loop to achieve this?

106
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:21,947
Let's take a look.

107
00:04:21,947 --> 00:04:24,270
You could create a variable
called "largest_so_far".

108
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,237
This is the largest
value that you have seen

109
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:28,369
in the list so far.

110
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,794
Now I haven't shown you any number yet,

111
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:32,241
so we'll just set this
to -1 to get us started.

112
00:04:32,241 --> 00:04:35,575
Now we see 3 and we're like,

113
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,493
"Oh, that's better than -1."

114
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:39,723
It's our first number so it's probably

115
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:41,113
the largest we've seen so far, right?

116
00:04:41,113 --> 00:04:41,946
Great.

117
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:42,779
41.

118
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,610
Oh, that's bigger than the
largest we've seen so far,

119
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,587
so we'll keep it.

120
00:04:45,587 --> 00:04:48,196
12 is not bigger than 41
so we're not gonna keep it.

121
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:50,721
Notice this keeping thing.

122
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:53,480
9 is not bigger than 41 so
there's no point to keeping it.

123
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,210
74 is bigger than 41, so we'll keep it.

124
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,506
Is this the largest number?

125
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,339
We don't know.

126
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,630
We don't know until we're done.

127
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,870
15, not better than 74.

128
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,055
So now we're all done and
hooray, hooray, hooray,

129
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,416
we have the largest number.

130
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,752
We have this variable that
we kept the largest number

131
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:14,231
that we'd seen up to this point.

132
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,037
Then when we know that
we're done at the end,

133
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:20,988
that becomes the largest.

134
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,213
So if you look at all the numbers,

135
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:23,474
keeping track of the largest so far,

136
00:05:23,474 --> 00:05:26,725
at the end of all the largest
so far and the largest

137
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,091
are the same thing.

138
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:30,547
That's how you get this idea of

139
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:32,943
something you're doing during the loop

140
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:34,452
is not really the answer,

141
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,371
but by the time the loop is done

142
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,621
you will have the answer.

143
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:40,697
So here's a bit of code that does this.

144
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:43,524
Use it with our numbers.

145
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:44,976
Let's take a look.

146
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:46,931
I have this variable
called "largest_so_far".

147
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:49,257
I set it to -1 before the loop.

148
00:05:49,257 --> 00:05:51,206
Remember there's a loop
before, and a loop after,

149
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:52,344
and a loop in the middle.

150
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:53,444
Before, it's -1.

151
00:05:53,444 --> 00:05:57,117
Now "the_num", remember
underscores are okay.

152
00:05:57,117 --> 00:05:58,827
That's my iteration variable.

153
00:05:58,827 --> 00:06:01,979
If 9 is greater than largest_so_far.

154
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,013
Well, largest_so_far is -1 so that's true,

155
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:05,360
so this code is gonna run.

156
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,677
We're gonna remember the new number.

157
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:11,336
This is 9, so 9 ends up in largest_so_far.

158
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:12,477
And then print it out.

159
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:16,519
So largest_so_far is 9
after we saw the number 9.

160
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,445
Then we do it again.

161
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,681
So now 41 comes in.

162
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:23,922
Is 41 greater than 9?

163
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:25,466
The answer is, "Yes, it is."

164
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:26,810
So we're going to run this code,

165
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,200
copy 41 into largest_so_far
and then print it out.

166
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,173
largest_so_far is 41 after
we saw the number 41.

167
00:06:37,173 --> 00:06:39,736
Now we're going to run
the loop again with 12

168
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:41,850
and you get the idea, I hope.

169
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,398
Is 12 greater than 41,

170
00:06:43,398 --> 00:06:45,070
which is the largest we've seen so far?

171
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,903
The answer is, "No, it is not."

172
00:06:46,903 --> 00:06:47,762
So we skip.

173
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:50,286
The largest_so_far stays 41,

174
00:06:50,286 --> 00:06:51,812
even though we saw 12.

175
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,979
Meaning we're sort of ratcheting up,

176
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:56,260
but we never ratchet back down.

177
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:01,454
We run it again with 3 and 41.

178
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,436
We skip this.

179
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:04,723
Then the largest_so_far is 41,

180
00:07:04,723 --> 00:07:07,129
even though we just saw 3.

181
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:09,287
And now we see 74.

182
00:07:09,287 --> 00:07:11,403
Is 74 greater than 41?

183
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:13,521
See, we never are looking
at all the numbers.

184
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:15,519
We're only are looking at
the window on the numbers

185
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,694
of the current number
that we're looking at.

186
00:07:18,694 --> 00:07:21,212
So is 74 greater than 41?

187
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:23,406
The answer is yes, so we run this code.

188
00:07:23,406 --> 00:07:25,812
Then we capture the 74.

189
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:29,723
We just saw 74 and it
is the largest_so_far.

190
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:32,971
And then we run it again with 15,

191
00:07:32,971 --> 00:07:36,750
but 74 is our largest_so_far
and so it skips.

192
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,739
So 74 remains largest so far after 15.

193
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:41,961
Now we're finished.

194
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,386
We just ran the last thing.

195
00:07:43,386 --> 00:07:45,419
Our loop takes care of everything

196
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:47,084
and jumps to this print
statement and says,

197
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:49,568
"Afterwards, largest_so_far is 74."

198
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:53,552
But at this point it's also the largest.

199
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:56,742
So largest_so_far became largest

200
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,095
when our loop finished.

201
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:00,858
So that sort of gives you this notion

202
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:05,820
of how we construct
something at the beginning,

203
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,528
some kind of thing that we're going to do

204
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,152
over and over and over again,

205
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:11,307
and then something at the end.

206
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:12,645
We've put some print statements in

207
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:16,994
just so we can watch it
and see what's going on.

208
00:08:16,994 --> 00:08:19,197
Coming up next we're going to talk about

209
00:08:19,197 --> 00:08:20,743
some more loop patterns.

210
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:23,025
Some counting, totalling, averaging,

211
00:08:23,025 --> 00:08:26,990
and finding the smallest number.

212
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,573
(relaxed jazz)
