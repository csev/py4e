00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:02,357
- [Charles Severance]
Hello and welcome back to

2
00:00:02,357 --> 00:00:03,840
Python as a Language.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,659
You'll notice that I'm wearing a hat.

4
00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:12,367
And part of the story of
the hat is that where I work

5
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:16,472
here at the University of
Michigan School of Information,

6
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:19,305
my office is in this
building called North Quad.

7
00:00:19,305 --> 00:00:22,721
And we call it Quadwarts sometimes,

8
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:24,892
because it's sort of got a square,

9
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,362
it sort of imitates an Oxford quad,

10
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:31,530
and so it seemed to me to
evoke notions of Harry Potter.

11
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:33,330
When we first moved into the building,

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:36,671
I joked in one of my
classes that we should have

13
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:40,020
a sorting ceremony for all
the students as they come into

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,061
North Quad for the first time.

15
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:44,293
And so that was cool, and I thought

16
00:00:44,293 --> 00:00:47,126
that I would belong in Gryffindor,

17
00:00:48,598 --> 00:00:50,852
like everyone wants to
be in Gryffindor, right?

18
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:52,071
They're the good guys.

19
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:56,952
And my students told me that
I couldn't be in Gryffindor,

20
00:00:56,952 --> 00:00:58,907
that I had to be in Slytherin.

21
00:00:58,907 --> 00:01:01,496
So you'll see me drinking
tea throughout the course

22
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:02,895
out of this teacup.

23
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:05,421
It's my Slytherin teacup.

24
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:07,699
I picked that up from Harry Potter World.

25
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:11,727
I went down to Florida and I
visited Harry Potter World.

26
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:13,477
And the reason that I

27
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:18,030
was sorted by my students

28
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,863
into Slytherin is also
because I teach Python.

29
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,160
And Python is like a snake.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,900
And so, if you think about
the people from Slytherin,

31
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,230
they are capable of talking to snakes.

32
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:36,841
And the class that we
were doing the sorting in

33
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:40,923
was a Python class, and so
it sort of made perfect sense

34
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:43,412
that you would have to be in Slytherin

35
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:46,711
if you were the Python
teacher and, of course,

36
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:49,391
your name is Charles Severance.

37
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:51,779
That sounds kind of like Severus Snape,

38
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,696
so I just accepted that

39
00:01:56,269 --> 00:01:58,197
I'm in Slytherin.

40
00:01:58,197 --> 00:02:00,849
So you all can be in
Gryffindor, but I can't.

41
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:01,682
I'm in Slytherin.

42
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:03,220
So I'm the bad guy.

43
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,301
Or the good guy. Depends on
how you look at it, right?

44
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,469
So what I'm going to do now is

45
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:14,110
I'm going to bring you
into Slytherin as well.

46
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,068
Because I'm going to teach
you the Python language.

47
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:22,789
Python is the language
that we Pythonistas talk.

48
00:02:22,789 --> 00:02:25,831
It was invented about over
20 years ago by a fellow

49
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,081
named Guido van Rossum, and away we go.

50
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,460
Now, even though I'm using this whole

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,329
snake, Slytherin thing,
it turns out that Python

52
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,751
was not at all named for Harry Potter,

53
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:40,770
because Python was
invented almost two decades

54
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,810
before Harry Potter was created.

55
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,761
And it wasn't for the snake.

56
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,179
It was actually Monty
Python's Flying Circus,

57
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:51,306
was the inspiration for the name Python.

58
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:54,249
Because Guido van Rossum
really wanted to create a

59
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:56,989
programming language that,
while it was powerful,

60
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:59,189
underneath it, in its very nature,

61
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:00,837
was a very powerful language,

62
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:03,699
he wanted it to be a
language that was fun.

63
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:06,169
And he wanted it to be a
language that was approachable.

64
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:08,169
And so that's why Python, recently,

65
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,919
has become so absolutely popular.

66
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,228
And it's easy to learn.
But it's also powerful.

67
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:18,967
And that's sort of the magic of Python,

68
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:23,227
is the ease of learning it,
the brevity of the programs,

69
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:26,977
the shortness of the
programs, and the power.

70
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:31,707
And so, we are going
to become Pythonistas.

71
00:03:31,707 --> 00:03:35,105
Now, as you learn to
be a software developer

72
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:38,010
using the Python programming language,

73
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,255
you are going to encounter syntax errors.

74
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:44,648
And I remember when I
used to get syntax errors.

75
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:48,467
And I remember my first programming class.

76
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:51,292
And I would type on card.

77
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:54,542
(clunky typing sounds)

78
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,796
And I would upload those
cards to the computer,

79
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:09,845
and the computer would
say, "You're not worthy."

80
00:04:09,845 --> 00:04:11,866
And I'm like, wait a sec,
those are pretty good cards,

81
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:14,696
how could you be so critical of me?

82
00:04:14,696 --> 00:04:16,542
You know, it'd say "syntax error."

83
00:04:16,542 --> 00:04:20,795
I really got sort of a
really bad attitude that,

84
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:23,467
somehow, this computer didn't like me.

85
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:26,305
And that I would make
cards, it would complain,

86
00:04:26,305 --> 00:04:27,865
and I would make changes to the cards,

87
00:04:27,865 --> 00:04:29,635
and it would still complain,
and I'd make changes,

88
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:30,737
and it would still complain.

89
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,947
I'm like, how can I win in this situation?

90
00:04:33,947 --> 00:04:35,265
And you're gonna feel the same thing.

91
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,448
You are absolutely gonna
feel the same thing.

92
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:39,607
You're gonna be struggling,
you're gonna be like,

93
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:42,175
"How come this computer hates me?"

94
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:44,925
Let me assure you right now,
the computer doesn't hate you.

95
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:47,006
The computer actually loves you.

96
00:04:47,006 --> 00:04:50,445
It just is not very good at
showing how it loves you,

97
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,708
or telling you how or why it loves you.

98
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:57,875
And so syntax errors are not
so much Python telling you

99
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:01,297
that you're bad or that you're
an inadequate programmer

100
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:03,534
or you should find something else to do.

101
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:06,177
It's really Python's admission
that it doesn't understand

102
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:07,936
what you're trying to say.

103
00:05:07,936 --> 00:05:09,735
And so you've gotta get used to that.

104
00:05:09,735 --> 00:05:11,866
And it's frustrating,
but you've gotta get used

105
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:14,307
to the fact that syntax
errors are your friend.

106
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:17,115
Python is saying, "Hey!
I got to line seven,

107
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:19,035
and I was doing fine up
to line seven, but boy,

108
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:21,975
in line seven, there's some little thing.

109
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:26,076
I don't know what the word
'else' means in this context.

110
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,755
Or you didn't indent it,
and so I'm kinda confused,

111
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:32,195
what did you mean? Please please
please help me." You know?

112
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:35,596
And so it's so much easier
for you to learn Python

113
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:38,075
than it is for Python to figure out

114
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:40,536
what you mean when you're writing code.

115
00:05:40,536 --> 00:05:42,377
So we have a number of
different ways to sort of

116
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:45,616
encode our instructions
when we talk to Python.

117
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:48,466
One is we just run Python
interactively on our computer.

118
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:50,886
Hopefully, by now,
you've got it installed.

119
00:05:50,886 --> 00:05:53,873
And you just type python
at a command prompt.

120
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:56,474
Either a Windows command prompt,
or a Linux command prompt,

121
00:05:56,474 --> 00:05:57,864
or a Macintosh command prompt.

122
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,884
And I've got some examples
of sort of how to get this

123
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:03,994
all started, get Python
installed, and away you go.

124
00:06:03,994 --> 00:06:05,982
Now you'll notice when you
run the Python interpreter,

125
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:07,683
the three chevron prompt,

126
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:11,449
Python is asking you "what next", right?

127
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:13,816
It's saying, I wanna talk to you,

128
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:16,785
I want you to tell me some Python to do.

129
00:06:16,785 --> 00:06:18,025
If you know the Python language,

130
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:20,726
you know what to say right here.

131
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:23,505
Now if you know Python, you
can type these languages.

132
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:25,944
You can say, oh, x =
1, which really means,

133
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:27,475
go find a piece of memory,

134
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,603
label it "x" and stick 1 in it.

135
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:32,143
Print(x) is like, go find that
thing where you labeled it x,

136
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:33,376
and bring me back that number

137
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:34,854
and tell me what I stored in there.

138
00:06:34,854 --> 00:06:37,277
Now why you wanna do this,
that's a different question.

139
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:38,586
These are very simple things.

140
00:06:38,586 --> 00:06:40,325
It's gonna take you a while
to get the big picture

141
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:41,335
of why we're doing this.

142
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:45,195
So just trust me that you
wanna learn these statements,

143
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:47,065
and then later we will successfully

144
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:49,456
turn those into a program.

145
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:52,875
So x = x + 1, the third line there.

146
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:57,397
x = x + 1 is not as it seems in math.

147
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:59,945
It basically says, hey, go
grab the old value of x,

148
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:01,874
add 1 to it, and stick it back in x.

149
00:07:01,874 --> 00:07:02,755
That's what that means.

150
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,305
So the equals sign really
has kind of an arrow to it,

151
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:08,465
and then we say hey go
look up that x thing

152
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:10,445
that we just did, and print that out,

153
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:12,365
and then we're gonna say quit.

154
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,545
So that's us talking to Python.

155
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:16,966
Now, you can type just about
any crazy stuff you want

156
00:07:16,966 --> 00:07:21,865
in here, and Python will
be unhappy and talk to you.

157
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:25,267
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna start talking

158
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:27,890
about the actual language of Python,

159
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,005
and what it is that we
have to say to make Python

160
00:07:31,005 --> 00:07:33,588
happy when we're talking to it.
