00:00:00,117 --> 00:00:03,182
- Hello and welcome to
Chapter 13, Web Services.

2
00:00:03,182 --> 00:00:05,319
So what we've been doing so far is

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,339
we've been using the
request-response cycle,

4
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:08,241
we've learned about sockets,

5
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:10,128
we learned about urllib,

6
00:00:10,128 --> 00:00:11,956
and we've actually
learned how to pull HTML,

7
00:00:11,956 --> 00:00:14,825
and even flat text off the internet,

8
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:16,819
but what we're gonna talk about now is

9
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:18,645
using that same request-response cycle

10
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,767
to retrieve information that is

11
00:00:20,767 --> 00:00:24,308
specifically designed for
programmatic consumption,

12
00:00:24,308 --> 00:00:27,341
so that, you know, we had
to have this beautiful soup

13
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:31,032
which sort of did a hack job or hard,

14
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:33,056
solve the hard problem of parsing HTML,

15
00:00:33,056 --> 00:00:35,457
but why not produce data in a format

16
00:00:35,457 --> 00:00:37,322
that makes good sense to a program,

17
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:39,255
because programs wanna talk to each other.

18
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:41,397
If you recall, the whole idea of a socket

19
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:43,894
is to have one application process

20
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:47,325
sending data to another
application process,

21
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:50,151
and so if we think
about this for a moment,

22
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,196
and we realize that we
have all these programs,

23
00:00:53,196 --> 00:00:55,109
they can be written in
different programming languages

24
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:57,069
and they're all connected and so

25
00:00:57,069 --> 00:00:58,528
they might wanna send data back and forth

26
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:00,668
through the network.

27
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:03,903
PHP programs, JavaScript
programs, Java programs,

28
00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:07,268
and so we have to decide on a protocol

29
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,961
that is independent of
any programming language

30
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:11,808
and then we call that the wire protocol,

31
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:14,181
because if you were to sort
of take some connection

32
00:01:14,181 --> 00:01:17,570
and watch the exact characters
that go back and forth,

33
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,539
that's what you would see
if you were monitoring

34
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,881
the wire, so that's why we
call that the wire protocol,

35
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:26,284
and so the idea is is that we have to

36
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:29,460
agree on a format that is
gonna represent the data,

37
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,688
and we can't a Python=specific format,

38
00:01:31,688 --> 00:01:35,330
or a Java format, and
when we take the data

39
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,252
from the internal representation,

40
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:38,539
maybe a Python dictionary,

41
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:41,844
so send it to the wire, we
call that act serialization,

42
00:01:41,844 --> 00:01:44,525
and that's going from sort of
the internal representation

43
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:47,198
to the serial representation,
or the wire representation,

44
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:50,088
and then, here is an example of person

45
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:51,443
with a name and phone number

46
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:53,304
with using less thans and greater thans,

47
00:01:53,304 --> 00:01:56,252
this is an XML example,
and then in a far end

48
00:01:56,252 --> 00:01:57,475
in a different programming language,

49
00:01:57,475 --> 00:01:59,945
it receives this and then deserializes it

50
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:02,186
and then turns it into
some useful structure

51
00:02:02,186 --> 00:02:04,415
inside that programming language,

52
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,287
and so this is an example of wire protocol

53
00:02:07,287 --> 00:02:09,524
that's using XML, and that's one of the

54
00:02:09,524 --> 00:02:11,250
formats we're going to talk about.

55
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,035
Another format that we're gonna talk about

56
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:15,372
is a format called JSON,

57
00:02:15,372 --> 00:02:19,472
JavaScript Object Notation,
and it is simpler and easier,

58
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:24,054
but it's not as precise
and descriptive as XML is,

59
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:26,384
and so, while you'll find
that most of the things

60
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:27,929
you run into, especially
if you're talking to

61
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:29,661
APIs of one form or another,

62
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:32,176
you'll find that JSON is very common.

63
00:02:32,176 --> 00:02:35,824
XML still holds sway in
places like documents.

64
00:02:35,824 --> 00:02:38,133
So if you look at docx at the end of a

65
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:41,317
Microsoft Word document, docx means that

66
00:02:41,317 --> 00:02:43,737
it's an XML version of the representation

67
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:46,150
of a word processing document.

68
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,573
So the first thing
we'll talk about is XML.
