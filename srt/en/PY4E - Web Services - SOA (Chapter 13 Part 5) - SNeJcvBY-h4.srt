1
00:00:00,378 --> 00:00:03,019
- So the service oriented
approach is a way we

2
00:00:03,019 --> 00:00:06,494
approach solving a complex
application problem

3
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:08,694
where all the data really isn't present

4
00:00:08,694 --> 00:00:09,802
in one computer system.

5
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,936
It's somehow spread out over the internet

6
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:15,526
connected by the internet
or internal network.

7
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:17,709
And so the idea is

8
00:00:17,709 --> 00:00:20,458
that some applications just can't

9
00:00:20,458 --> 00:00:21,870
contain everything.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,894
The perfect example is a travel website,

11
00:00:23,894 --> 00:00:26,102
that can book you a flight,

12
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:28,433
book you a car, buy tickets,

13
00:00:28,433 --> 00:00:30,128
book you a hotel

14
00:00:30,128 --> 00:00:31,039
and do all these things.

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,183
Well, that travel website is neither

16
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:35,718
a hotel, nor a rental car company,

17
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:36,753
nor an airline.

18
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:37,586
But what it really does

19
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:39,361
is it talks to all these services

20
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,148
somewhere else on the web on your behalf

21
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:43,020
and it makes reservations for you.

22
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,800
And so you have this convenient

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,920
user interface that says,

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,488
oh here's your whole vacation

25
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:49,383
I'm going to figure all this stuff out.

26
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,502
Now you say, go, and it goes

27
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:52,596
book, book, book, book.

28
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:54,635
And it books on all these other systems.

29
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:57,545
Now it requires a lot of infrastructure,

30
00:00:57,545 --> 00:00:58,827
a lot of coordination

31
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:01,147
and a lot of effort to make sure

32
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:03,517
that your application can talk

33
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:04,714
and these other services

34
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:06,229
that are out there on the internet

35
00:01:06,229 --> 00:01:08,707
have good contracts and you know exactly

36
00:01:08,707 --> 00:01:10,779
how to send data to them.

37
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,915
And get data back from them.

38
00:01:12,915 --> 00:01:15,091
And so initially when you're building a

39
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:16,310
service-oriented architecture

40
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,907
often you have one application.

41
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:18,851
And it's all internal,

42
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:21,226
often it's all one language.

43
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:22,481
And then maybe you'll say,

44
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:24,422
oh wait a sec we wanna take part

45
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:25,689
of what we do and put it in

46
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:26,522
a second system.

47
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:28,224
And then sort of come up

48
00:01:28,224 --> 00:01:29,578
with a set of rules between the systems

49
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:31,481
and then more, and more, and more.

50
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:32,522
And this is a video

51
00:01:32,522 --> 00:01:33,514
that talks a little bit

52
00:01:33,514 --> 00:01:35,985
about the process and complexity

53
00:01:35,985 --> 00:01:39,036
about taking these interfaces

54
00:01:39,036 --> 00:01:41,052
between applications and applying

55
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:43,635
standards to those interfaces.
