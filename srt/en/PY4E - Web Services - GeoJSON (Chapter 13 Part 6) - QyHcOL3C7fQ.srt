1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,386
- So now that we're solving our problem

2
00:00:02,386 --> 00:00:04,933
using a series of cooperating applications

3
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:07,170
communicating across the network,

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,439
we're gonna talk a little
bit more detail about

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,045
a notion of what we call web services.

6
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,291
And in this, we're going to
take a different perspective.

7
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,058
Instead of building our application

8
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:18,808
and breaking it into pieces,

9
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:20,659
we're gonna have an
application that's gonna really

10
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:22,691
consume an API from somebody else.

11
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:28,091
So there is some other provider
of this API that's not us.

12
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:31,144
And so if you're gonna
talk to somebody's data

13
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:34,764
like Google or Amazon or Twitter,

14
00:00:34,764 --> 00:00:37,691
they're gonna say, you
have to use our API.

15
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:38,735
So what's that?

16
00:00:38,735 --> 00:00:40,979
So an API is a contract that says look,

17
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,280
if you do this, and
this and this and this,

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,868
we're gonna give you data this way,

19
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:47,753
and they set the rules, they
study what the URLs are,

20
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:50,455
they'll tell if it's XML or JSON,

21
00:00:50,455 --> 00:00:52,672
and this is called the
Application Program Interface,

22
00:00:52,672 --> 00:00:56,077
and it's something you
read and you understand.

23
00:00:56,077 --> 00:00:58,895
And so you go look at the documentation.

24
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:01,948
This is the documentation
for the Google Maps API.

25
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:05,081
So it turns out that Google
knows a lot about Maps.

26
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,595
It knows a lot of data, it
knows how to search Maps,

27
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:11,180
and it actually provides
some of those features to you

28
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,724
that your application
can take advantage of.

29
00:01:13,724 --> 00:01:16,513
I took advantage of this at one point by

30
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:18,591
asking all the students in one section

31
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:21,275
in one of my online course
where they were from.

32
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:23,087
And I just let them type in where it was

33
00:01:23,087 --> 00:01:25,891
and then I said, well I don't
know how to code any of that

34
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:29,477
so I used this API using
what's called geo-coding

35
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:32,062
to look all those places
up and get precise

36
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:33,773
latitudes and longitudes for the ones

37
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:36,841
Google could figure out and
that saved me a lot of work.

38
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:39,105
Now, these are expensive resources

39
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:42,726
but I could be patient and
make use of these resources

40
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:47,098
which as long as you use them
not too much they can be free.

41
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:48,869
We'll talk a little bit
more about rate limiting

42
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,681
and what's free and what's not in a bit.

43
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:52,858
But you start by reading documentation.

44
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:56,830
It says, do this, hit
this URL, hit that URL.

45
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,276
So if you read that documentation,

46
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:02,682
you'll find that there
is a URL that you can hit

47
00:02:02,682 --> 00:02:07,144
and they tell you where to
go and then you go this URL,

48
00:02:07,144 --> 00:02:09,152
you got a question mark and then you say

49
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:11,785
address equals and then ann arbor plus

50
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:13,161
and there's all these rules.

51
00:02:13,161 --> 00:02:15,419
These are called URL encoding
rules when you have key values

52
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,670
on URLs, the plus means space
and percent two C means comma.

53
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,569
So these are called URL encoded.

54
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:27,303
Don't worry to much about
that, 'cause we're gonna have

55
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:29,960
a magic library like
we always do in Python

56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,495
that takes care of this.

57
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:34,045
And so if you were to hit this URL,

58
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:36,915
you type in the exact
right way in your browser,

59
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:38,686
you will get back a JSON document.

60
00:02:38,686 --> 00:02:40,951
It's an object that has key value pairs.

61
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:42,735
First value's this status.

62
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:44,424
Then it has these results and it's a list

63
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:46,107
and you dive down and eventually,

64
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:47,628
you can kinda find that
latitude and longitude

65
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:50,849
of the thing that you are looking for.

66
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:53,207
And so the idea is can we right a program

67
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,867
that can read this.

68
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:57,663
And so here's our little
program that reads this.

69
00:02:57,663 --> 00:03:01,096
And a lot of this is sort of comfortable.

70
00:03:01,096 --> 00:03:03,737
You've already seen some of this.

71
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:07,175
You import your lib,
we've deparsed in JSON,

72
00:03:07,175 --> 00:03:10,001
we grab the URL, and
then we're gonna write

73
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,918
a little Y-loop that's
gonna ask for a location,

74
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:15,686
and we can type that location that in.

75
00:03:15,686 --> 00:03:18,921
And we've got to concatenate with this URL

76
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:22,449
the location equals, and
there is a bit of code,

77
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,953
a library that called parse URL and code

78
00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:28,515
that takes the key and the
value so the address equals

79
00:03:28,515 --> 00:03:31,537
and then whatever this text
is that read in from the user

80
00:03:31,537 --> 00:03:33,908
that goes in here and it
does that URL and coding

81
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:36,842
with the pluses and percent
two C and all that stuff

82
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,105
is taken care of.

83
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:42,498
And that is our URL that
we're gonna pass to URL Open.

84
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,301
So we print out that
we're gonna retrieve it.

85
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:46,871
It prints this out and if
you look at this too long,

86
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:51,235
it has all that fancy stuff
on it, and then we read it.

87
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:53,686
I mean, we open it with URL Open,

88
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:55,261
and then we read it and decode it.

89
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:57,418
So these two things, hit this URL,

90
00:03:57,418 --> 00:04:02,312
decode it, and then we
retrieved 1669 characters

91
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:04,847
'cause it's just a, in this case,

92
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:07,230
because we've decoded
it, data is a string now

93
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,174
that's read is bytes and data is a string.

94
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:15,433
So we read that many
characters, 1669 characters.

95
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:17,385
And then we're going to take this data

96
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:19,826
and we're gonna parse it with JSON

97
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,108
and we might get the bad data here.

98
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,353
It might blow up, but it might work.

99
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:26,858
And so in this case, it works.

100
00:04:26,858 --> 00:04:29,394
We have an error that basically
says if we got a bad thing

101
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,898
we're gonna blow up, but in
this case it doesn't blow up.

102
00:04:31,898 --> 00:04:34,561
And so now we're going
to sorta dig through.

103
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:37,938
And if you go back

104
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:40,051
Let me just go back.

105
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:43,565
So the results, sub zero geometry.

106
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:45,222
Let's show you how that works.

107
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:48,681
So results is the first key.

108
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:51,481
So this is a dictionary
with a key of results

109
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:54,371
but then it has a list and the zero item

110
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:56,833
this list starts here and goes there

111
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,722
and there's, I'm only
gonna show part of it

112
00:04:59,722 --> 00:05:01,363
but there's many things here.

113
00:05:01,363 --> 00:05:03,196
So the zero item is this.

114
00:05:03,196 --> 00:05:05,180
This is the subzero.

115
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,230
And then geometry within
that sub zero item.

116
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,760
So if we look at that, it is

117
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,801
the outer dictionary,

118
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:17,450
the first item in the list, sub geometry.

119
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,313
So that grabs one part.

120
00:05:20,313 --> 00:05:25,950
That grabs this part right here.

121
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,521
And then we're going to
go into location and lat.

122
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,241
And those are just keys within keys,

123
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:32,377
a dictionary within a dictionary.

124
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:35,985
And so you see it says,
sub location, sub lat.

125
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:37,653
And so that is literally gonna pull

126
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:41,274
out of that complex
structure, that will pull

127
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,726
the latitude out and
then in the next line,

128
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:46,137
pull the longitude out, so we can pull

129
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,590
the latitude and longitude
out and then we print it out.

130
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,641
We can go into results of
zero formatted address.

131
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:58,205
And that goes into results
zero formatted address

132
00:05:58,205 --> 00:05:59,833
and that pulls this little bit out.

133
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,738
Now, it takes a little
while to write this stuff,

134
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:03,461
and you have to put a lot of debug

135
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:05,327
and you don't necessarily figure out

136
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:07,564
this complex bit here at the end,

137
00:06:07,564 --> 00:06:10,059
but you know, you print it,
you don't get what you want,

138
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:11,672
you say, oh wait a
second that wasn't a ray,

139
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,504
so I gotta add a sub zero
there to get the first one

140
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:16,938
out of the ray but
eventually you figure it out.

141
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:19,005
And it's not all that difficult.

142
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,249
The first few times you do it,

143
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:22,391
you're like what am I doing?

144
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:24,118
But after a while, you
realize, oh I'm just sort of

145
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:27,105
tearing this apart and
digging deeper and deeper

146
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:30,237
into this data structure
which I just retrieved

147
00:06:30,237 --> 00:06:32,938
over the internet from
Google and I learned

148
00:06:32,938 --> 00:06:36,061
something good from that.

149
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,903
So up next, we're gonna
talk about how sometimes

150
00:06:38,903 --> 00:06:41,515
these APIs protect themselves with keys

151
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:45,013
or signatures and why that happens

152
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,930
and how to solve those problems.

153
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,847
