1
00:00:00,446 --> 00:00:01,449
- So now we're gonna talk to you

2
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:04,627
about one of the common
applications of dictionaries

3
00:00:04,627 --> 00:00:06,587
and that is making histograms.

4
00:00:06,587 --> 00:00:09,014
It's counting the frequency of things.

5
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:11,314
And so if you think of a histogram as

6
00:00:11,314 --> 00:00:12,535
you know, it's a little graph

7
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:16,653
and there is A, how
many A's, how many B's,

8
00:00:16,653 --> 00:00:18,608
and now many C's, and there's
a histogram that says,

9
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:20,788
oh there's this many of
that and this many of that.

10
00:00:20,788 --> 00:00:23,014
And these are like buckets,
these are frequencies

11
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:24,536
and this is how many times it happens.

12
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:25,619
So a histogram.

13
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:26,767
But we're gonna do this thing

14
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:28,691
where we're gonna count people's names

15
00:00:28,691 --> 00:00:31,081
and we're gonna kinda
count how many that we see.

16
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:33,213
The interesting thing
that we're gonna solve,

17
00:00:33,213 --> 00:00:35,525
just like many of the
things in the computer,

18
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:36,996
is we can't just sort of look at the data,

19
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:38,750
we gotta look at the data iteratively,

20
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,323
one piece of data at a time.

21
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:43,935
So I'm gonna give you a little problem.

22
00:00:43,935 --> 00:00:46,996
I'm gonna show you a series
of names, one at a time,

23
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:50,724
and I want you to count, for each name,

24
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:52,519
make a little bucket,
and then keep counting

25
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,626
how many things for each
of the different names.

26
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:56,956
You'll notice that you
have to start with one

27
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,044
and then you move across.

28
00:00:58,044 --> 00:01:04,429
So just watch this and tell me how many,

29
00:01:04,429 --> 00:01:05,786
how many, what's the most common name

30
00:01:05,786 --> 00:01:07,467
of the set of names I'm about to show you

31
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:10,508
and how many do we see.

32
00:01:10,508 --> 00:01:44,313
(classical music)

33
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,414
So how many, what was the most common name

34
00:01:46,414 --> 00:01:48,369
and how many times did you see it?

35
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,259
That's the question.

36
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,198
Now, here comes the reveal.

37
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:54,237
So for humans, it's so much easier for you

38
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:55,478
to just look at this, and you think

39
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:57,650
how did my brain look at
that, and you're like,

40
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,679
okay what is pretty common?

41
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:02,412
Oh, maybe...

42
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:03,859
Maybe cwen is common.

43
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:07,390
Oh, cwen, cwen, cwen, no.

44
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,232
Maybe zhen is common.

45
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:12,477
Do one, two, three, four, yeah.

46
00:02:12,477 --> 00:02:14,937
Anybody else, marquard's got three,

47
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:15,909
csev...

48
00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:19,584
So you'll notice how our
minds, without computers,

49
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:23,525
we just sort of bounce, branch and bound.

50
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:27,706
We have hypothesis and then
we decide, oh, it's zhen.

51
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:29,579
That's it, and there's four of them.

52
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:32,399
Now, how did your brain think about this

53
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:35,342
as we were going through
them one at a time?

54
00:02:35,342 --> 00:02:38,363
Well, my guess is if you
really had to do this a lot,

55
00:02:38,363 --> 00:02:40,415
you would make a little picture like this.

56
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:43,852
Then what you would do
is if you saw a new name,

57
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,259
XYZ, you'd add it to the list

58
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,683
and give it a tick mark of one,

59
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:49,990
and then if you saw csev again,

60
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,367
you'd give that a tick mark,
and if you saw XYZ again,

61
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:54,229
you'd make a tick mark,
and then you'd make,

62
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:56,482
you keep adding to
these tick marks, right?

63
00:02:56,482 --> 00:02:57,662
And that's how you would do it,

64
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:00,467
and you wouldn't, like many
of the things we do in a loop,

65
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:02,524
you wouldn't really know
what the most common was one

66
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:04,236
until the end, and then you'd sorta

67
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:06,290
take a look at these
numbers, and you say, okay,

68
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,025
that's the most common number,
and then you'd be done.

69
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:13,419
But you have to watch 'em one at a time.

70
00:03:13,419 --> 00:03:16,278
You can't just bounce around.

71
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:20,087
And so that's how we're
gonna use dictionaries

72
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,564
to achieve that.

73
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:23,954
Again, instinctively as humans,
we just look at the stuff,

74
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,350
but if you had a million things,

75
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,859
you'd probably wanna
write a Python program

76
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:28,013
and use dictionaries.

77
00:03:28,013 --> 00:03:29,279
And so this is the idea,

78
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,700
and there's two basic things that happen.

79
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,390
One is the first time you see a name,

80
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,017
you gotta say, is this name there already?

81
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:38,175
If it's there already, you
really just wanna add one to it.

82
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:39,926
That's the adding of a tick.

83
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:42,533
Or, you wanna see for the first time,

84
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:44,760
you know, blah blah blah
blah blah, and give it a one.

85
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,081
And so you can use the name as the key,

86
00:03:49,081 --> 00:03:51,758
and then one is the value, and
then first time you see cwen,

87
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:52,951
you stick one in there.

88
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:55,146
And so at this point,
inside the dictionary,

89
00:03:55,146 --> 00:03:58,231
sorta dynamically adding as
soon as it sees a new name,

90
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:00,651
it adds another slot in here.

91
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:03,120
But then if you see the same
name again, like cwen again,

92
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,203
then you end up with a one,
add one to it and so it's two,

93
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:07,892
and so at that point, cwen is two.

94
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:11,456
And so you can see how you
can both extend the dictionary

95
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:13,200
by encountering a new name,

96
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,219
or adding when you see a name

97
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:19,019
that you've already seen before.

98
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,327
The problem with dictionaries
is, like everything in Python,

99
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,717
there are rules about
what you can and can't do,

100
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:26,706
and one of the, I think,
kinda frustrating things

101
00:04:26,706 --> 00:04:29,811
about dictionaries is that you can't just

102
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,152
look for a key that doesn't exist.

103
00:04:31,152 --> 00:04:32,757
So this is a fresh, brand new dictionary.

104
00:04:32,757 --> 00:04:34,089
We do a constructor there,

105
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:36,510
and we print out sub-csev, and boom,

106
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,617
it blows up, and that's bad.

107
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,091
But we can solve this by the in operator.

108
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:42,952
The in operator we've
used in the for loops,

109
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:45,318
we've used it in the lists,
we've used it in strings.

110
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,888
So that is a question.

111
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:49,257
It's saying, is csev in ccc?

112
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:52,808
Well, this is this empty one,
and so it is, no it is not.

113
00:04:52,808 --> 00:04:54,547
Csev is not in ccc.

114
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:56,565
And so not using this in operator,

115
00:04:56,565 --> 00:04:57,910
we can avoid the traceback.

116
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,729
We can say, if it's not there, put it in.

117
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,499
If it is there, add one to it.

118
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:06,033
And that leads us to this bit of code.

119
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:09,503
And that is the kind of
code that we're gonna build,

120
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,566
this is a histogram code, okay?

121
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:15,265
And so this is gonna have
name as our iterator.

122
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:17,578
Names, sorry, I made
them singular and plural.

123
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:19,227
That's nice, but...

124
00:05:19,227 --> 00:05:21,496
So name is gonna be
csev, cwen, csev, zqian.

125
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:23,282
Now normally we'll be
reading this form a file,

126
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,828
but for now we'll keep it easy.

127
00:05:25,828 --> 00:05:26,977
We're gonna go through this.

128
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:28,985
And we're gonna have
counts as our dictionary.

129
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:31,735
So that starts out empty,
and we're gonna do a simple

130
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:33,636
if then else every time through the loop.

131
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:34,883
If the name we're looking at

132
00:05:34,883 --> 00:05:37,612
is not in the dictionary
already as the key,

133
00:05:37,612 --> 00:05:39,444
then set it to be one.

134
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:44,346
If it's not, go get the
old value, counts of name,

135
00:05:44,346 --> 00:05:46,612
and then add one to it
and stick it back in.

136
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,903
So this is, this line right here, is new,

137
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:52,087
adding a new thing, and
this line right here

138
00:05:52,087 --> 00:05:54,953
is adding some things to existing things.

139
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:57,418
And you do this long enough,
you start with an empty one,

140
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:58,587
and you do this long enough,

141
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:02,798
at the very end it will
print out the histogram

142
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:05,293
that you're looking for,
histogram you're lookin' for.

143
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:07,455
And so you say, oh we've seen csev twice,

144
00:06:07,455 --> 00:06:09,045
zqian once and cwen twice.

145
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:10,681
And so that's the idea.

146
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:17,457
And so this can run a
million times if you want.

147
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:22,020
Now, this notion of checking
to see if a key exists,

148
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,150
and doing one thing if it doesn't exist

149
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,374
and doing another thing if it does exist

150
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:32,209
is such a common practice
that the dictionary object

151
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,529
has this method called get,

152
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:39,081
that collapses these
four lines into one line.

153
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:41,098
And so the idea is,
you're gonna do one thing

154
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:42,681
if it's in there, and
you're gonna retrieve

155
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:45,217
the current thing,
otherwise you're gonna pick

156
00:06:45,217 --> 00:06:46,126
a default value.

157
00:06:46,126 --> 00:06:47,305
In this case we'll pick one.

158
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:48,753
I mean, pick zero.

159
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:52,701
This is like the default, right,
meaning what is not there.

160
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:55,241
And if you say counts, now
counts is a dictionary,

161
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:58,521
.get, that's like
string.upper, that's a method,

162
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:01,472
you give it a key and then a default,

163
00:07:01,472 --> 00:07:03,894
and if the key exists, you
get back what's in the key,

164
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:07,331
if the key doesn't exist,
you get the default, okay?

165
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:08,760
And with no traceback.

166
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,147
This works, so the best
way to think about this is,

167
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:17,182
those four lines are
equal to that one line,

168
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,658
cause x is either gonna be
whatever was in there before,

169
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:22,154
if it exists, or it's going to be zero.

170
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:23,704
Now the nice thing about zero

171
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:24,581
is the next thing we're gonna do

172
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:27,168
is we're gonna add one to it,
so that's gonna get us to one.

173
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:33,615
So, collapsing that
loop that we saw before,

174
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:37,124
collapsing that loop, we can
make it just a one line loop,

175
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,460
and this will become an idiom.

176
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,667
This will become something
that you will get used to

177
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,325
and you will use over
and over and over again,

178
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:46,154
and after a while, right
now you're looking at it,

179
00:07:46,154 --> 00:07:47,939
boy-o-boy, that's a lot of syntax

180
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:50,031
and semi-colons and whatever.

181
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:51,439
After a while, you just type this

182
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,378
and not even think about it.

183
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:53,814
It's an idiom.

184
00:07:53,814 --> 00:07:55,989
It's basically, included in this idiom,

185
00:07:55,989 --> 00:07:58,968
is how to both create new
entries in dictionaries

186
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:02,578
and update existing entries
by adding one to them.

187
00:08:02,578 --> 00:08:05,086
So, everything else in this is the same.

188
00:08:05,086 --> 00:08:07,106
Name is gonna go through
these five values,

189
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:09,360
and we're gonna say counts of name equals

190
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,976
counts.get(name, 0)+1.

191
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:15,787
And so if, for example, this
already has a one in it,

192
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,045
then this is gonna be
one plus one becomes two.

193
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:22,094
If it's not, it's gonna be
zero plus one equals two,

194
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:26,408
and so this is the idea of, if
new, set it to one, not zero,

195
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:28,751
set it to one, 'cause the
first time you see something,

196
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:30,785
the count should be one, not zero.

197
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,568
So that's why we make this default.

198
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,414
Now the get can be used for anything.

199
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,246
It just so happens that
zero is a common default,

200
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:39,504
because it's really common
that we're using this

201
00:08:39,504 --> 00:08:41,467
to basically make a histogram, right?

202
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,086
A little histogram of A, B, C, right?

203
00:08:44,086 --> 00:08:45,938
And so we need to make a D,

204
00:08:45,938 --> 00:08:48,030
but then the histogram
has to start at one.

205
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,669
So that's basically the
simplified counting with get,

206
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,599
and there's a lot of things
that we're going to do

207
00:08:55,599 --> 00:09:00,389
inside of Python that do
have to do with frequencies

208
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,705
and how many times have
certain things happened

209
00:09:02,705 --> 00:09:05,975
and this pattern is a really good pattern

210
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:07,681
to absolutely know.
