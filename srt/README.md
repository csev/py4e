SRT files for PY4E
------------------

This folder is designed to allow community translations of the SRT files for the Python for Everybody
YouTube PlayList.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj7Bp8-DfGpfAfDBiblRfl5p

Since community translations was removed from YouTube - we now need to do this in
github - and the manual upload/download will be done by hand.

The files will be in per-language folders like `en`.  The files will be named as follows:

    PY4E - Introduction (Chapter 1 Part 1) fvhNadKjE8g.srt

The first part of the file name is the title of the video and the second part is the
video id to keep translations connected to the video versions.

Dr. Chuck will need to download and populate the english SRT files and you can copy and
create the translatons using github pull requests.  Keep the file names the same.  Git
will convienently keep track of which files have been added or changed.
