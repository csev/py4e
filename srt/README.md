SRT files for PY4E
------------------

This folder is designed to allow community translations of the SRT files for the Python for Everybody
YouTube PlayList.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj7Bp8-DfGpfAfDBiblRfl5p

Since community translations was removed from YouTube - we now need to do this in github - and the manual upload/download
will be done by hand.

The files will be in per-language folders like `en`.  The files will be named as follows:

    PY4E - Introduction (Chapter 1 Part 1) fvhNadKjE8g.srt

The first part of the file name is the title of the video and the second part is the video id to keep translations
connected to the video versions.

Dr. Chuck will need to download and populate the english SRT files and you can copy and create the translatons
using github pull requests.  Keep the file names the same.  Git will convienently keep track of which files have been
added or changed.
