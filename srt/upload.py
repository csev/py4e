# Sample Python code for youtube.captions.insert
# NOTES:
# 1. This sample code uploads a file and can't be executed via this interface.
#    To test this code, you must run it locally using your own API credentials.
#    See: https://developers.google.com/explorer-help/guides/code_samples#python
# 2. This example makes a simple upload request. We recommend that you consider
#    using resumable uploads instead, particularly if you are transferring large
#    files or there's a high likelihood of a network interruption or other
#    transmission failure. To learn more about resumable uploads, see:
#    https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/media_upload
