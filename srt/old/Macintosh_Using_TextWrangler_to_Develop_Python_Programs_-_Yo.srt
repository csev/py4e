1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,930
Hello.

3
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:06,110
Welcome to running Python
programs with TextWrangler

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,380
on the Macintosh.

5
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,510
So, I'm here on Google and
I've typed TextWrangler

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,480
and I can just go to the
TextWrangler website.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,470
And we're going to
download TextWrangler.

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,000

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,600
and we're playing
with usability.

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,300
I guess we've got a nice
little download button here;

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,180
download now.

12
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,510

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,080
OK, so we're going to download.

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,729
Right there.

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,054
That made that work.

16
00:00:34,054 --> 00:00:34,720
So here we come.

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,530

18
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,720
OK, so now it's downloaded
and is mounting up the image.

19
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,290

20
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,360
And so I'll come
over here and all

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,900
we do is we drag the
TextWrangler into applications.

22
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:58,860
And then since I'm not a
super user on this account,

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,650
I have to authenticate,
which means

24
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,492
I have to type an
account and a password.

25
00:01:02,492 --> 00:01:04,450
And I've already done
this once, and so I'm not

26
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,830
going to bother copying it.

27
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,442
So we'll cancel this.

28
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:11,900
But it will copy
in and then you'll

29
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,370
have TextWrangler installed.

30
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,800
And I can close
all these windows.

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,470
And you have TextWrangler.

32
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,390
And I'm going to unmount
this TextWrangler drive.

33
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,260
So I have a nice clean desktop.

34
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,720
So I want to run TextWrangler.

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,300
And the easiest way is to
start in with Spotlight

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,090
and do TextWrangler and click on
TextWrangler when it comes up.

37
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,370
And so it's going to ask me
a few questions when we first

38
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,480
start out.

39
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,269
And it's got this cool
little window here,

40
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:42,310
which I'm going to close.

41
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,670
That shows us recently
opened documents.

42
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:49,650
And so I'm going to write
some Python code here.

43
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:58,410
And I'm going to say
print hello world.

44
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,250
Oops.

45
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,690
I want to say hello world.

46
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:07,200
And I'm going to save this
by saying File save as

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,669
and I'm going to instead of
going straight to my desktop,

48
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,410
you might have to push this
little button to see these,

49
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,020
I'm going to make a
folder called assign0.

50
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,740
And then inside
assign0 I'm going

51
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,610
to name my file firstprog.py.

52
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,970

53
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,310
Now you'll notice that this
assign0 appeared as soon

54
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,800
as I made it in the
desktop, because this folder

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,110
desktop under places is
the same as my desktop.

56
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,480
So now I'm going
to save my file.

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,260
And so you'll
notice that it does

58
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,860
what's called syntax coloring.

59
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:45,240
And shows me the fact that
it's now got a double quoted

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,840
string in Hello world.

61
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,410
So now I'm going to run Python.

62
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,060
Now there's a couple
ways to do it.

63
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:54,460
First I'll show you the
built in one in TextWrangler.

64
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,960

65
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,260
You go up to here,
pound exclamation

66
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,700
and say run in terminal.

67
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,860
And this will
start up a terminal

68
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,540
and then run the Python
command interpreter and feed it

69
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,060
our program.

70
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,240
So we say run in terminal.

71
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,050
And so there's some stuff here.

72
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,440
This is just sort
of cruddy overhead.

73
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,790
But right here it basically
is my output for my program.

74
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,510
And it says, oh, in the
file users demo desktop,

75
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,800
we've got a syntax error
on line one, hello world.

76
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,760
Invalid syntax.

77
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,620
Now it doesn't tell
us much about how

78
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,040
we might fix this showing
just how not clever Python is,

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
but it certainly knows
it we've made a mistake.

80
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,960
But we know it's in line
one so let's go back

81
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,480
and take a little more
closer, we meant to say print.

82
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,750
So I forgot the t.

83
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,360
So let's go ahead and say t.

84
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,571
And we'll save it.

85
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:52,640
I didn't mean to lock it.

86
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,320
I'll just save it.

87
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,490
File, save.

88
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:59,340
And then I'll run
it in Python again.

89
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,060
Run in terminal.

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,820
And then I see my
little Python output.

91
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,319
So you've got to realize that
everything other than this bit

92
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,530
here is the Python output.

93
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,890
And I can make changes.

94
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:11,350
I close each time.

95
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,180
Hello there world.

96
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,610

97
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,110
Oops.

98
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,410
Hello there world.

99
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,279
And I will use a shortcut.

100
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,339
Now this command ask.

101
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:21,880
There's little apple symbol.

102
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,290
Apple s will save it.

103
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,831
So I'm not going to
actually save it.

104
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:27,080
I'm just going to save
it with Command s.

105
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,350
And then I'm going to run it.

106
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,430
Oops, I didn't mean
to run a debugger.

107
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,620
No I do not want to do that.

108
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,120
Close.

109
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,020
Die.

110
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,100
Again, I'm going to
run it in terminal.

111
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,109
And then away we go.

112
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:39,900
And you'll see that my
program has changed.

113
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,870
And so we can see that
I can run this program

114
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:45,510
and change it over and over.

115
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,545
Now after a while this
will get kind of tiring.

116
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:50,120

117
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,140
I'll hide the terminal.

118
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,120
Get rid of it.

119
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,761
And especially when you need
to be in a particular directory

120
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:57,510
and if you're opening
files, and so you're

121
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,390
going to want to run
the terminal by hand

122
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,790
and learn a few
terminal commands.

123
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,060
And so I'm going
to type terminal.

124
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,860
Terminal is, we've
actually been using this

125
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,850
but now I'm going to
open a separate one.

126
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,840
And now I'm at this
command prompt where

127
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,720
I can type commands.

128
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,890
Let me make that a
little bit bigger.

129
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,740
So you can see it better.

130
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,860
And one of the commands
is ls, which stands for;

131
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,050
I don't know, list all
my files or something.

132
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,630
In Windows this'd be
Derby, but in Unix it's ls.

133
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,330
And one of the
folders that I see

134
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,140
is the desktop folder there.

135
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,350
So I'm going to say cd desktop.

136
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,780
And then I'm going to say ls.

137
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,440
And you'll see that I have
effectively this little

138
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,270
folder I've got
there, is shown as one

139
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,287
of the folders in
my desktop folder.

140
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:47,120
So it's a subfolder.

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,801
So I'm going to go into a SS,
and zero, and do another ls.

142
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,425
If you're wondering
where you're at you

143
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:57,480
can always type this
command PWD, which stands

144
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,290
for print working directory.

145
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:04,940
So I'm in the main hard drive
under users, demo, desktop,

146
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,040
assign0.

147
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,720
And then within assign0, I've
got one file; firstprog.py.

148
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,772
If I want a little more
detail, I add minus l to my ls.

149
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:15,730
And it can tell me that
it's a file, how big it

150
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,590
is, when it was created etc.

151
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,839
Now if want to run this, I
simply type the command Python

152
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:23,380
firstprog.py.

153
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,940

154
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,070
And Python says start
the Python interpreter

155
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,720
and then feed it firstprog.py.

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,470
And then Python runs my little
program and gives me output.

157
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,280
Now a couple of shortcuts.

158
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,790
First shortcut.

159
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,879
Hit the up arrow,
and you can hit

160
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,170
the up arrow a couple of times.

161
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,660
You can hit it couple times.

162
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,090
I'm hitting up arrow,
then I'll hit down arrow.

163
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,850
I can run previous commands.

164
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,440
OK?

165
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,780
I can also type part of a
file name like Python fur

166
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,830
and then hit Tab,
and it actually

167
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,860
auto completes because
it knows the file name.

168
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,895
It looks at the file
name and says oh, fur

169
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:03,910
is the beginning of,
there's only one file

170
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,720
that begins with fur so
I'll finish it for you.

171
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,350
And so the command
line is pretty easy.

172
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,850
So if you want to
make a change, you

173
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:20,410
can just have the command line
sitting there in one window,

174
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,380
and make a change.

175
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,790
And I'm going to just
hit Command s to save it.

176
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,940
And then I'm going to
come here and hit up arrow

177
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,360
and I'm going to hit enter.

178
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,610
So now I can make a mistake,
like a syntax error.

179
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,160

180
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,900
I can hit Command s to save it.

181
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,880
And I can go over here in an
up arrow and run it again.

182
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,160
And it tells me whoa, line
two you've got a syntax error.

183
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,040
And then I'll go ahead and
fix this, print, sorry.

184
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,240
And so now I've got valid
Python and if I hit up

185
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,800
arrow, hit Enter.

186
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,620
It says two lines; print, sorry.

187
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,210
Now you'll also
notice that it's doing

188
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,480
what's called syntax coloring.

189
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,810
It's showing us what part's
key words, what part's not

190
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:09,544
a key word.

191
00:08:09,544 --> 00:08:11,210
And I don't know if
you noticed but when

192
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,810
I had the mistake it was
black because blue means

193
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,400
it's a Python keyword,
print is just text

194
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,410
so it doesn't really know
what we meant by that.

195
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,570
And then when I get the
syntax right turns blue.

196
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,120
It's not really
critical, it just

197
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
helps you understand
what's going on.

198
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,520
Syntax coloring
gives you good clues.

199
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,362
You can see what line you're on.

200
00:08:31,362 --> 00:08:33,820
Down here in the lower left
hand corner, what line your on,

201
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,860
what column your in.

202
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,919
And that can actually help you
as you look at syntax errors

203
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,900
when it tells you, ah.

204
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,900
The syntax error is on line two.

205
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,010
So that gives you a good
start using, downloading,

206
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,820
and installing,
text edit and using

207
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,970
it to do Python on Macintosh.

208
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,750
Thank you.

209
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,568
