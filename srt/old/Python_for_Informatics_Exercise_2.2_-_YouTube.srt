00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,530
Hello, welcome to one
of our Worked Exercises

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,130
for the Python for Informatics
Exploring Information book.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,780
I'm Charles Severance,
and I'm your host

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,740
for this Worked Exercise.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,040
As always, this material is

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,980
Attribution and you're
welcome to use it.

8
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,760
So in using these
exercises, don't just

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,850
start using these
exercises because they

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,410
make everything too easy.

11
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,110
Part of the idea of
a book is that we

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,390
start with some easy exercises
and you stretch your skills

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,240
with those easy exercises, and
then the exercises get harder.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,577
And if you take all of
the scaffolding, all

15
00:00:38,577 --> 00:00:40,410
of he supporting materials
that we give you,

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,820
and take the easy way through
the exercises at the beginning,

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,726
then the harder exercises
will be so much harder

18
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:48,600
that you'll have less
of a chance to make it.

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,640
So these early exercises
are designed to be easy.

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,430
Try to use these exercise
videos as the last way out.

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,820
OK?

22
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,764
This exercise assumes that
you have Python installed,

23
00:01:02,764 --> 00:01:04,930
that you've installed your
text editor, your NotePad

24
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,030
or TextWrangler, or
whatever one you like.

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,614
Please set tab expansion,
that's my little advertisement.

26
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:14,030
You learned a little bit about
how to use the Command Line

27
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,360
Interface, how to
create directories,

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,076
how to navigate
directories, and then

29
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:20,340
how to run Python in the
Command Line Interface,

30
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,590
interactively and interactively.

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,110
And then how to use
your text editor

32
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,760
to edit and run Python program.

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,840
So if you haven't
done that, please

34
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,200
go to www.pythonlearn.com and
click on the appropriate links

35
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,420
to get that all taken care.

36
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,780
So this is the first exercise
that we are going to do.

37
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,220
In this particular
exercise, and it's

38
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,480
a variation on the classic
first program, where

39
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,790
we ask the user for their
name and we print out

40
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,570
a simple welcome.

41
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,460
So let's go ahead and
get started on that.

42
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,685
So I've got some
things in my dock

43
00:01:56,685 --> 00:02:02,340
to quickly start Text
Wrangler, and let

44
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,520
me make this size a
little bit different,

45
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,660
and also a terminal window
and I'll do my Python running

46
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,699
in this terminal window.

47
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,324
Of course I'm doing
this on a Macintosh

48
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:13,030
and I'm sorry about that.

49
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,600
Hopefully you'll be
able to translate,

50
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,470
and then in those
first exercises,

51
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,590
I'll try to tell you what would
be different on a Windows box.

52
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,962
So of course on Windows, this
terminal is your command line.

53
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:27,170
Many of the commands are
different, some are similar,

54
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,550
I'll tell you about them.

55
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,610
And here's Text Wrangler and so
the first thing I'm going to do

56
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:37,432
is I'm going to make a
folder on my desktop.

57
00:02:37,432 --> 00:02:48,820
I'm going to call that
folder py4inf and then I'm

58
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,370
going to make in
that folder, I'm

59
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,550
going to make another
folder called, let's not,

60
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,450
I'm not going to
make this folder.

61
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,500

62
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,980
So I'm going to make
a Python program

63
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:06,260
in py4inf called welcome.

64
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:13,580
So I'm not going to write
the program even though it's

65
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,850
only two lines long.

66
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,100
I'm going to write the
program that I know works

67
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,100
and I'm going to make sure that
I can get my Python to work.

68
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,180
And so this is sort
of inner development,

69
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,800
even if this is a
simple two line program,

70
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,150
I'm going to start with
a one line program.

71
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,410
And I will go into my desktop
and find the folder py4inf.

72
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,940

73
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:46,110
And I'm going to save this
file as howdy, howdy.py.

74
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,700
Also the thing
that you'll notice

75
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,590
is that now that I've
saved it with a py suffix,

76
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:53,320
my text editor is smart
enough to detect coloring,

77
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,250
so note that print
is a reserved word,

78
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,780
and hello world is a string.

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,790
So if I, for example,
just made a mistake

80
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,410
and I said hello
space world, it would

81
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,070
notice that the string stopped
and so this is helping me

82
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,600
with the pink to
know what's going on.

83
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,000
So let me save this,
I just saved it.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,603
So I'll do a File, Save, command
S is my shortcut for that.

85
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:24,440
And if I look at my
py4inf it's sitting there.

86
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,000
Now in my command line, I have
to go into the desktop folder,

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,640
I did that cdd tab,
and then to py4

88
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,340
and then tab because
it does tab completion.

89
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,890
And then in Windows
you would type dur,

90
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:45,390
but in Unix we will type lx.ls.

91
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,500
Now to run it in Windows, you
would do something like c:/

92
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,010
Python two five Python.

93
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:03,435
OK, this is not Windows so I'm
just going to type Python howdy

94
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:05,960
and I'm typing how Tab.

95
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,830
You get used to these things.

96
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,930
So now I'm going to run it
and it says hello world.

97
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,610
So here's the output
of my application.

98
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,032

99
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:18,490
Another quick thing
in terminals is

100
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,470
you can hit the up arrow,
watch and I'll run it again

101
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,580
by hitting Enter.

102
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,746
So that you don't have to
keep typing over and over,

103
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:27,130
even in Windows it's a
little yucky type this thing,

104
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,980
but you just type it once and
then hit up arrow and enter, up

105
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,060
arrow and enter, you can
do it over and over again.

106
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:42,486
OK so now let's write our
first program and, what's

107
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:45,730
that program supposed to look
like again, enter your name.

108
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,130
OK.

109
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,100
So we are going to use
the raw input function.

110
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:59,020
I'm going to put my
variable called lmnop.

111
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,670
That Is a very
bad variable name,

112
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,550
it's a very non-numeric
name but it's

113
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,160
to emphasize that
it's a variable.

114
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,310
Raw input is the
function that takes

115
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,420
as its parameter,
as an argument,

116
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:19,890
enter your name
close parentheses.

117
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,154
So now I'm going
to save this file,

118
00:06:22,154 --> 00:06:26,880
I'll just leave the Hello
World in here, save the file,

119
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,142
also I'll be sure
to cut save, and now

120
00:06:29,142 --> 00:06:30,225
I'm going to run it again.

121
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:31,750
Just say Python, howdy.py.

122
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,330
Oops, that's not
what I was expecting.

123
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:43,300
It's complaining that I have
an end of line, well, EOL,

124
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,872
end of line, while
scanning string letter.

125
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:48,080
Boy, this is turning out to
be harder than I thought.

126
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,950
Oh but look here, to
the pink parentheses?

127
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,790
I forgot my quote, close
quote and I'll save that.

128
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,120
I'll use cursor up
to run it again.

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,380
Enter your name.

130
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,960
Now that doesn't look so good.

131
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,800
See how it's jamming to
enter your name there?

132
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,850
Was I supposed to
put a colon there?

133
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,960
I was supposed to put
a colon and a space.

134
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,564
OK, so let's take a look.

135
00:07:13,564 --> 00:07:14,980
I need to put a
colon in the space

136
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,844
there so let's go back
here, colon and a space

137
00:07:18,844 --> 00:07:21,260
and that will make this look
a little prettier when I save

138
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,390
the file, and I run it again.

139
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,600
Enter your name, Chuck.

140
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,330
Now it works, OK.

141
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,600
Let's make this a little bit
bigger so we're seeing it.

142
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,370
OK but now it's not
saying Hello World,

143
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,600
it needs to say Hello Chuck.

144
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,400
Now Python when you're
putting things together

145
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,810
with a comma on
a print statement

146
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,210
it actually adds the
space for you, so.

147
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,617
We won't add space
inside the string,

148
00:07:49,617 --> 00:07:51,200
we could add a space
inside the string

149
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,526
but then we'd get two spaces.

150
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:54,650
And I'm just going to put
the variable named lmnop.

151
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,710

152
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,590
Now I'll save that.

153
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:05,320

154
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,600
There we go and it works.

155
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,587
Now what if I made
a mistake here?

156
00:08:08,587 --> 00:08:10,670
Let's just make another
mistake, I should probably

157
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,200
make more mistakes.

158
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,350
I'm going to call it
lmnoq instead of lmnop.

159
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,556

160
00:08:19,556 --> 00:08:26,280
So if kind of works,
but blammo, in line two,

161
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,410
lmnoq is not defined
because this variable,

162
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,360
I put it in lmnop as
the variable name,

163
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,409
but then I pulled it back out,
of lmnoq is the variable name.

164
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,980
I can look at the line numbers.

165
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,280
Look down here--
this is the line m

166
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,970
and then I can quickly
go find the line.

167
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,130
OK?

168
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:49,960
So let's go fix that lmnop, save
it again, cursor up, run it,

169
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,180
enter your name, Chuck, works.

170
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,340
So now I've got this
particular sign.
