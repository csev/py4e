00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,389
Hello and welcome to
www.pythonlearn.com.

3
00:00:04,389 --> 00:00:05,930
On this particular
video, we're going

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,860
to show you how to write
a simple program using

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,940
a text editor and a terminal
on the Raspberry Pi.

6
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:18,340
Raspberry Pi is a really cool
system, that runs Unix-- Linux.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,560
And so here we have a desktop.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,527
Once you've got your
Raspberry Pi working,

9
00:00:22,527 --> 00:00:23,610
you should have a desktop.

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,010
It as a Start icon
at the bottom.

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,969
And we're going to start.

12
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:29,760
We actually don't have
to install anything.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,210
For the Macintosh
and Windows, we

14
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,140
had to install various things.

15
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,750
But now everything
comes on Linux,

16
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,430
because it's sort of
set up for programmers.

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,450
I'll start a simple text editor.

18
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,490
And I'll write a little Python
program in the text editor.

19
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,480
We call these scripts.

20
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,150

21
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,360
And the classic thing to do
is to write a program that

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,010
says, "hello world."

23
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:56,600
And I'm going to do
a save of this file.

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,620
And I'm going to
put on my desktop.

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,390
And make a new
folder called assn0.

26
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,580

27
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:10,170
And then in assn0, I'm going to
call my file hello.py and save

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:10,670
it.

29
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,044
I've got my screen
a little small

30
00:01:12,044 --> 00:01:13,340
so you can see a little better.

31
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,610
You'll notice on that desktop
that folder showed up,

32
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,540
and if I click
inside the folder,

33
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,007
there is indeed hello.py.

34
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:21,590
So now what we're
going to do is we're

35
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,520
going to-- there's a lot
of ways you could run this.

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,200
There are things-- there
are tools called IDLE,

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,690
and you may have even learn
and used these before.

38
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,180
I prefer showing you
really how stuff works.

39
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,280
The technique I'm going to show
you works pretty much the same

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,650
on a Macintosh or
a Windows, where

41
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,370
you actually talk
the operating system

42
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,250
and say, hey, run
my Python for me.

43
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,000
So I'm going to open
up a terminal window,

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,805
and a terminal window let's us
type operating system commands.

45
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:50,370

46
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,640
So for example, the
first command is ls.

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,520
That list the directories and
files of wherever you're at.

48
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,872
The pwd stands for
print working directory.

49
00:01:58,872 --> 00:01:59,830
It say where you're at.

50
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,850
And I'm the /home/csev.

51
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,110
That's my account.

52
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,030
And cd says change directory.

53
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,160
And I'm going to change
into the desktop.

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,580
And just as a-- I can
type D-E Tab, and as

55
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,320
long as that's unique,
it automatically

56
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,600
goes to the desktop.

57
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,670
And then Enter.

58
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,250
If I type ls.

59
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,970
Well, I see kind of
what's on that desktop.

60
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:23,060
That desktop has a
folder called assn0.

61
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,150
Assn0.

62
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,260
0.

63
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,340
And then I go into
that folder, assn0.

64
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,000
So you navigate one folder in.

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,420
And you'll see it's telling
you, roughly, where you're at.

66
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,570
And if I do an ls here,
in this command line,

67
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,290
it says, oh, you've
got one file.

68
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,892
And it's named hello.py.

69
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,600
And if you look at
this, it's showing you

70
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,370
the exact same information.

71
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,320
So we're really-- this
terminal is a different view.

72
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:51,582
And I like it, because we can
type commands here, and-- be

73
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:53,841
smaller-- you can type commands.

74
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,340
I can tell you
exactly what to type.

75
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,510
It's easier to write
documentation, frankly.

76
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,890
So we want to run this program.

77
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,255
We wrote the program
over here, and now we

78
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:03,960
want to run the
program in this window.

79
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,060
So we type python hello.py.

80
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,280
And that says, go
find Python-- that's

81
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,780
like Microsoft Word or
some other program, that

82
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,480
happens to be the Python
itself that we're running.

83
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,010
And feed it hello.py.

84
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,850
This one file.

85
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,160
So when I type Enter,
it's going to run it.

86
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,290
And so it's going to
interpret these commands.

87
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,400
And I told Python that the
first thing, and last thing,

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,490
I wanted to do was to do
a print of "hello world".

89
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,570
That of course is--
they're traditional.

90
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,770
This is a script.

91
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,570
It's a series of commands.

92
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:41,510
Print "howdy world."

93
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,700
Print "yo world."

94
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,920
I can have all kinds
of things in here.

95
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,200
Print "peace out."

96
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,777
I don't know what to type.

97
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:55,360
Now there's some
shortcuts that you'll

98
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,806
get used to using pretty fast.

99
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:58,430
I can keep saying
File Save, but you'll

100
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,480
notice Control-S is a save.

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,800
And you'll notice this
little asterisk up here.

102
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,710
Watch when I press Control-S.
That asterisk means the file's

103
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,620
been modified, but not saved.

104
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,900
This will save you a
little bit of insanity.

105
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,920
Make sure you know that.

106
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,170
It's like, oh, it's not saved.

107
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,250
So Control-S. Pressed.

108
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,530
And now it's been saved.

109
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,269
That's how I know it's saved.

110
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,880
And it's been saved over here.

111
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,310
And now I am going to say
python hello.py to run it again.

112
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,392
And now it's yelling at me.

113
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:31,360

114
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,860
Oops.

115
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,049
I see what I did wrong.

116
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,090
I should have said print.

117
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,290
I should have said, instead of
pring, I should've said print.

118
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,390
You think it would be
smart enough to know that,

119
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,810
like, why isn't this
guy doing print.

120
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,460
So now I have to
save it again, so I

121
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,869
do Control-S. And now
here's another trick,

122
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,410
you cant hit the Up Arrow and
run the previous command again.

123
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,140
So hit the Up Arrow and hit
Enter, and there is my output.

124
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:54,810
OK.

125
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,924
So not too hard.

126
00:04:55,924 --> 00:04:57,340
Everything's already
pre-installed

127
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,200
on the Raspberry Pi Linux.

128
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,950
Pretty much all Linux are going
to have something like this.

129
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,280
And so away we go,
thanks for listening.
