00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,470

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:00,970
Hello.

3
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,345
My name is Charles Severance,
and I'd like to welcome you

4
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:06,530
to the launch of
online.dr-chuck.com.

5
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,200
I decided to create my
own MOOC environment,

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,090
mostly because my personal
research is in technology,

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,570
and teaching and learning.

8
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,890
And I absolutely love
teaching in Coursera,

9
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,640
and I love working
with Stanford Class2Go.

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,790
But really, for me to
do the kind of research

11
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,250
that I want to do,
I need to create

12
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,030
my own environment,
an environment that I

13
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,040
can do AB testing myself.

14
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,290
I don't want to just be in
someone else's environment.

15
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,930
And I continue to work in
all those environments.

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,857
And I want to sort of take
what my core values are.

17
00:00:38,857 --> 00:00:39,940
I'm passionate about open.

18
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,590
I'm passionate
about open source.

19
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,710
I'm passionate
about open content.

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,420
And now, this MOOC adds the
dimension of open enrollment.

21
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,182
So I'm trying to make it so
that my MOOC, based on Python,

22
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:51,890
this particular class
I'm going to teach,

23
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:54,380
which is the first I'll put
into my MOOC environment,

24
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,150
is really as much
for teaching teachers

25
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,050
as it is for teaching students,
being that when you're

26
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,230
done with this class,
you can walk away

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,650
with the material in this class.

28
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,060
You can remix this material.

29
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,900
You can teach your own classes.

30
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,120
It's based on this free
book that I've written

31
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,740
called Python for Informatics.

32
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,699
This is an open book you
have to buy the books.

33
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:14,740
We print them here at the
University of Michigan,

34
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,695
but you can download
a PDF, and HTML,

35
00:01:17,695 --> 00:01:19,570
and you can have the
source code to the book.

36
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,580
It's Creative
Commons Attribution.

37
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,840
And so the course
I'm going to teach

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,620
is also a very special course.

39
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,710
It means a lot to me.

40
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,810
I have a passion
about teaching people

41
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,340
to program without
trying to teach

42
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,670
them to be computer scientists.

43
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,770
I think it's wonderful to
be a computer scientist,

44
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,978
but I also think a lot of
people just need to program

45
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:42,300
and just need to kind of
understand how data works.

46
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:46,000
And so this class is going to
stay away from mathematics.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,880
It's really going
to focus on data.

48
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,700
The book is called Python
for Informatics Exploring

49
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,980
Information.

50
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,290
So I hope that you'll consider
joining me on this quest

51
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,240
and come join the class.

52
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,889
We'll have two classes, one
would start January 14, 2013,

53
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:03,430
and the other will be this thing
called the playground, which

54
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,010
you can come and join any time.

55
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,924
I'm not giving any
certificates or badges

56
00:02:07,924 --> 00:02:08,840
or anything like that.

57
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,730
I will have kind of a hall of
fame that if you, you know,

58
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,220
pass the class, you can put
yourself in the hall of fame

59
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,000
if you so choose.

60
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,590
If you don't want to,
you don't have to.

61
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,980
So I thank you for
thinking about joining me

62
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,910
on this expedition.

63
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,250
I hope you, like I said,
that you enroll and play

64
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,916
with some of the
things that I've put up

65
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:26,140
and give me some feedback.

66
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,570
This whole thing is a beta test.

67
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,740
I'm just one guy, and I'm
like coding this up by myself,

68
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,080
and trying to teach my
classes and write this code

69
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,980
and keep these systems running.

70
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,690
So be a little patient.

71
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,980
And I'm always
looking for feedback.

72
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,380
You know, see me
on Twitter @drchuck

73
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,912
or let me know how you think.

74
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:48,370
We'll see how the next couple
of months go as I try to make

75
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,030
my own personal MOOC
environment online.dr-chuck.com.

76
00:02:53,030 --> 00:03:00,789
