00:00:01,992 --> 00:00:44,810

3
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,975
So JSON is the world's best
loved data interchange format.

4
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:51,410

5
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,204
I discovered it in 2001.

6
00:00:55,204 --> 00:00:57,370
I don't claim to have
invented it because it already

7
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:58,940
existed in nature.

8
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,955
I just saw it, recognized
the value of it,

9
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:03,880
and gave it a name
and description,

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,730
and showed its benefits,
but I did not invent it.

11
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,570
I don't claim to be the first
person to have discovered it.

12
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,050
There were other people
who, I later found out,

13
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,440
had come along the
same idea in 2000.

14
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,290
The earliest instance
I found of JavaScript

15
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,020
being used as a data interchange
format was at Netscape in 1996.

16
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,750
So it's an idea that's
been around for a while.

17
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,430
And if you look at other
data representations

18
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,530
like the property lists that
were used at NeXT, and then

19
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,120
later at Apple.

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,190
Except for a couple
of cosmetic changes,

21
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,220
it's the JSON notation as well.

22
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,170
So it seems like it's
an inevitable sort

23
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,890
of representation for
data, at least data

24
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,250
that is intended to be consumed
by programming languages.

25
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,610
And ultimately, that's all data.

26
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,600
I started with JavaScript
but my first application

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,320
was facilitating
communication between programs

28
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,080
written in JavaScript and
servers is written in Java.

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,330
So I recognize that even though
it was born out of JavaScript,

30
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,750
it could be and should
be language independent.

31
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,199
So I simplified it
as much as possible.

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,640
Took as much out, tried
to make the simplest

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,680
possible specification for how
to structure data and put it

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,793
on the wire.

35
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:22,590
And that ultimately
became called JSON.

36
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:28,860

37
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,700
In 2001, I was in a
company I had started

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:37,510
called State Software, and we
developed a platform for doing

39
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,120
applications which
could be delivered

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,650
through unmodified web browsers,
what today is called AJAX

41
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,970
But in 2001, that was
kind of a radical idea,

42
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,890
and not many people would
believe that was even possible,

43
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,820
or if it were, that
it was a good idea.

44
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,730
But we produced some
brilliant demonstrations

45
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,730
and we were starting
to make some progress

46
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,240
in trying to convince, you
know, potential customers

47
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,180
that they should adopt the style
of application development.

48
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,080
And as part of the
description, we'd say,

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,920
and then we use this JSON idea
for communicating the stuff

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,010
back and forth.

51
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,630
And they'd say
JSON, what's that?

52
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,770
It's this thing we
found in JavaScript

53
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,020
and it's really great.

54
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,360
And they'd say oh we can't use
that, we just committed to XML,

55
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,670
so no we can't.

56
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,860
But XML was wrong for
all of these reasons.

57
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,890
It's hugely expensive, much
harder to use, all that.

58
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,930
Well, we can't use
that thing you did

59
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,435
because it's not a standard.

60
00:03:32,435 --> 00:03:33,670
I said, it is a standard.

61
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,980
It's a proper subset of ECMA
262, which is a standard.

62
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,110
They say no that--
that's not standard.

63
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:44,090
So I decided if I want to
be able to use this thing,

64
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,920
I need to make it a standard.

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,120
So I bought JSON.org
and put up a web page

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,030
and sort of declared
it's a standard.

67
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,530
That's it.

68
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:53,620
That's all I did.

69
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,940
I didn't go around trying
to convince industry

70
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,532
and government and
everybody that this

71
00:03:58,532 --> 00:03:59,490
is what they should do.

72
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,130
I just put up a website.

73
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,510
Basically, a one page website.

74
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,530
And over the years, people
discovered it and realized,

75
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,970
oh yeah, this is so much easier.

76
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,160
I'm just going to do that.

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,220
I

78
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,890
The thing I never
understood about XML

79
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,810
for data interchange,
OK so basic-- generally,

80
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,190
the pattern is
you've got a query,

81
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,920
you send it to the server,
it gives it to the database,

82
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,210
and you get back this
XML thing, but then you

83
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,510
have to send queries
to that in order

84
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,400
to get the data out of it.

85
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,450
Why can't you just
give it to me in a form

86
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,440
where I know what it is and
I can use it immediately.

87
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,990
And so that was the main
benefit of JSON, I think.

88
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,880
It wasn't that curly
braces are so much

89
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,005
better than angle brackets.

90
00:04:44,005 --> 00:04:46,740
I mean ultimately
none of that matters.

91
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,420
The thing that mattered was that
the data structures that JSON

92
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,810
likes to represent are
exactly the same data

93
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,250
structures that programming
languages represent.

94
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,260
You know when Ajax was
formulated, the X in AJAX

95
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,480
was supposed to be for XML,
and the smart kids right away

96
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,280
realized, well this is too hard.

97
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,820
We don't want to
be doing XML here.

98
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,855
And some of them discovered hey,
you can use JSON here instead.

99
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:11,790
And It is so much
easier, so much faster.

100
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,960
So they started doing that and
for while, there was a debate.

101
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,100
Some people were arguing
Jesse James Garrett

102
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,470
said the X stands for XML.

103
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,290
So you can't use
anything but XML.

104
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,200
That didn't last very long.

105
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,690
There were a number of
other alternatives to XML

106
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,700
that were being considered
around those times,

107
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,680
but JSON was the only one
that was designed specifically

108
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,340
for AJAX.

109
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,940
Probably the boldest
design decision

110
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,410
I made in designing JSON was to
not put a version number on it.

111
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,350
So there is no mechanism
for revising it.

112
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,580
So JSON, we're stuck with it.

113
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,150
Whatever it is in its
current form, that's it.

114
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,290
And that turns out to be
it's best feature because it

115
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,460
wants to be a low level thing.

116
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,910
In its basic infrastructure,
its the thing

117
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,490
that you pile
everything else on.

118
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,730
And it's sort of the equivalent
of alphabet in a language.

119
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,190
And we might make
up lots of words

120
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,410
in lots of ways of
having sentences,

121
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,060
but it's very uncommon
to make up new letters.

122
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,270
And that's sort of the
place where JSON lives.

123
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,830
So it's good that it's
not going to change.

124
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,660
I expect maybe
someday, we'll find

125
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,520
that there are really important
things that JSON doesn't

126
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,330
do like cyclical structures.

127
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,700
Graphs are not easily
represented in JSON.

128
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,292
They can be, but it requires
a level of interaction,

129
00:06:30,292 --> 00:06:31,250
a little bit more work.

130
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,940
Someday, we might decide we
don't want to do that work

131
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,080
and then we replace JSON
with something else.

132
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,970
We will not extend
JSON to do that.

133
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,740
We will replace JSON.

134
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,240
And even after we
do that replacement,

135
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,670
everything that was ever
developed that still uses JSON

136
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,990
will still work because
JSON will never change.
