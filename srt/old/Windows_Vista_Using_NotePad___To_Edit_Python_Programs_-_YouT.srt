1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,950
Hello and welcome to
our how to use Notepad

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,220
to run Python applications.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:09,900
This is part of my open
and free textbook Python

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,510
for Informatics--
Exploring Information.

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,219
At this point, you should
have hopefully by now

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,870
installed Python.

8
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,220
If you haven't yet
installed Python,

9
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,350
you can go-- my book is
really any Python version two

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:28,360
is fine-- 2.5, 2.6, 2.7.

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,130
The simplest thing to do
is to go down to this link

12
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,820
right here, which is the
Windows x86 mSI installer.

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,810
If you're in doubt
as to whether or not

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:41,950
you're a Windows
64 or x-- 32-bit,

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,150
just go ahead and
grab the 32-bit.

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,222
Download it, run it.

17
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:46,430
I won't go through that here.

18
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,350
It's straightforward.

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,894
It's pretty much the same as
running most install packages.

20
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:54,060
The other thing that you're
going to want to install

21
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,460
is programmer editor.

22
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,720
I recommend Notepad
for Windows users.

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,160
You really don't
want to use Notepad.

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,530
It will mess up your
programs and turn them

25
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,640
into various things and not
save them the right way.

26
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,420
So we just want a
programmer editor

27
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,690
that understands programs.

28
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,190
It's going-- it'll
be good for HTML.

29
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,620
It'll be good for CSS,
good for lots of things.

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,734
So again, download that.

31
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:18,650
There's a couple ways.

32
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,560
You can just go
Notepad Plus in Google

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,330
and find it and
download and install it.

34
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,788
But I'm going to
assume that you've

35
00:01:24,788 --> 00:01:26,300
done both of those things.

36
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,716
So now what I'm
going to do is I'm

37
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:31,700
going to show you how to run
the program assuming you've

38
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,920
installed these two things.

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,716
So let's go ahead and
start Notepad Plus Plus.

40
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:38,890
I've already got here.

41
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,000
And there we go.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,590
So now I'm going to write my
first Python program print

43
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,640
"hello world"-- world.

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,550
I'm not a very good typer.

45
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:53,220
OK, so then what
we've got to do is

46
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,510
I've got to save it somewhere.

47
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,662
So we're going to run this.

48
00:01:56,662 --> 00:01:58,080
This is just editing a file.

49
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,840
So I'm going to
save it, Save As.

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,660
And I'm going to put
it on to my desktop.

51
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,410
And I'm going to name
the file firstprog.py.

52
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,612
Now, you might want to
put this in a folder.

53
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:13,070
If you're going to
be using, please

54
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,420
don't put names in
your folders, OK?

55
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,734
I mean spaces in your folders.

56
00:02:16,734 --> 00:02:18,400
So I could put this
in a folder, but I'm

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,680
going to put it on my desktop.

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
So the saving shows
up right here.

59
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,290
It is indeed on my desktop.

60
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,290
Now, to actually run this,
we're going to run it

61
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,600
through the command line.

62
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,491
There are many ways
to do this, but I

63
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:30,240
prefer running it
through the command line

64
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,850
so you really get
a sense of control

65
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:36,460
rather than clicking on things.

66
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,160
So this version
of Windows, I have

67
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,790
to start a command prompt
CMD-- so start CMD.

68
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,450
Sometimes, it's start run CMD
depending on your Windows.

69
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,730
But one way or another,
you get this little black

70
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:51,680
and white beautiful
little screen.

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,710
And where I'm at is telling
me the current directory.

72
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,330
I'm in the C drive
user screen caster--

73
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,040
that's my home directory.

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,990
And I can go one folder
down to go into my desktop.

75
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,000
And when I'm in my
desktop in this window,

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,350
it's the same as here.

77
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,900
So if I do a dur, which is
the command to list the files,

78
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,850
I see firstprog.py sitting in
the exact same place that I am,

79
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,560
OK?

80
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,030
So the way that you run this
is you simply type firstprog.py

81
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,390
at the command line.

82
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,240
We're going to run a
Python program and Python

83
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,690
sort of-- Windows
understands that

84
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:33,650
files that end with the
suffix PY are Python programs.

85
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,920
And so here is my first program.

86
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,920
But it's saying I've
got a syntax error.

87
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,845
It says something, something,
something, print "hello world".

88
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,220
Let me look at
this more closely.

89
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,880
Print-- oh, oh, oh.

90
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,174
I should have called that print.

91
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:51,840
Oh, there we go.

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,300
We see syntax highlighting.

93
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,750
So now I'm going to save this.

94
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,730
Oops-- File, Save.

95
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,070
Now, here's a little
trick that you can do.

96
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,890
Seeing as how I just
typed firstprog.py

97
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,690
and I want to run the
same command again,

98
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,810
I just hit the up arrow
and it automatically

99
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,710
knows what my
previous command is.

100
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,480
You can scroll
through these things.

101
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,350
Away we go.

102
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,880
Firstprog.py-- OK, that
works a little better.

103
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,430
It says hello world now.

104
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:24,200
So you just basically will
write second, you know?

105
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,590
You do stuff here in your
Python and you will save it.

106
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,590
Save it and then you'll
hit the up arrow run it.

107
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,460
And there we go.

108
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,070
I'm changing.

109
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,300
So this is the Python program.

110
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,590
It's stored both on your
desktop and here you can run it.

111
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:45,650
OK, so that is basically
the idea of how this works.

112
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:50,420
And-- oh, let me show
you one more thing.

113
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,600
Sorry, I was checking my notes.

114
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,310
If you want to run the Python
interpreter interactively,

115
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:00,770
you have to type its full
path-- C:-- in my case,

116
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,280
I've got Python
2.7 installed here.

117
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:13,630
Python27/python.exe-- oh,
I didn't do that very well.

118
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,880
But here, I typed the up arrow.

119
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,130
And I type EXE.

120
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,010
And so now I'm at
the chevron prompt.

121
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,750
And so I can say,
like, print yo.

122
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,239
I could say x equals 5 print 5.

123
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,780
Now to get out of
the chevron prompt,

124
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,520
you either type quit with
parentheses or Control-Z.

125
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,470
And I will take
Control-Z to exit.

126
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,520
And that exits the
Python interpreter,

127
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,920
the interactive
mode of Python, OK?

128
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,510
Thanks a lot.

129
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,060
Bye.
