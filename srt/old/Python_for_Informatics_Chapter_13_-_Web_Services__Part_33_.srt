1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,170

2
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,768
Most of the skills
that companies

3
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,059
are looking to hire for, they
don't actually even teach

4
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,680
you in college these days.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,200
One Month is an online
learning platform

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,005
with a very simple idea.

7
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:12,560
What if you could learn
anything in one month?

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,770
I tried to learn how to
code using online resources,

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,920
and I found that almost all
of the resources I found

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,440
were so complicated and were
just not made for beginners.

11
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,240
So One Month it's a simple
approach to that problem.

12
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,360
Every single month you
can decide, what do I

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,920
want to tackle this month.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,640
How do I want to
level myself up?

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,790
So right now you can
learn how to code.

16
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,640
You can learn growth
hacking, content marketing,

17
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,810
web security.

18
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,430
You can learn how to
build mobile apps.

19
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,800
And that's just beginning.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,020
We're constantly
releasing new classes

21
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,290
based on what the
students are asking for.

22
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:51,790
One Month is about
real results that

23
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,240
will impact your career,
your skills, your abilities,

24
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,930
your future.

25
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:03,106
