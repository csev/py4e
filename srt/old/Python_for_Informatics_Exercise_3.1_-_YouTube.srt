00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,810
Hello, and welcome
to a worked exercise

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:05,730
for Python for Informatics,
Exploring Information.

4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,060
I'm your host,
Charles Severance.

00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,810

8
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:14,390
So again, you're supposed to
try to work these exercises

9
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,130
yourself before
you attempt them.

10
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,990
These are good crutches to
make sure you understand,

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,840
but make sure you give
it a try yourself.

12
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,100
And if you don't understand how
to basically create and edit

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,070
programs, you should go back
to www.pythonlearn.com and work

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,130
through some of the installation
instructions for Python

15
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,960
in your text editor.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,120
So here's our exercise.

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,390
We're going to do the classic
rate times pay with over time.

18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:47,510
And so the idea is that
you have pay times rate.

19
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,650
And for 40 hours, you
get the basic rate.

20
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,150
And if you work above it, you
get one and a half times that.

21
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,790
So if it's $10 an hour,
you get $15 an hour

22
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,600
for the hours above 40.

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,470
So let's go ahead and
start Text Wrangler

24
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,536
and start a command line.

25
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:05,780
I will close that.

26
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,500
Close our drawer.

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,210
Make it smaller.

28
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,990

29
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:19,460
And I'm going to go into
the desktop, go to py4inf.

30
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,000
See I've got a few files here.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,160
And in this case, I am
going to open hours1.py.

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,340
And I'm going to immediately
save it as hours2.py.

33
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,757
I mean, why rewrite all
that stuff we did before?

34
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:42,340
I guess I can get
rid of this one now.

35
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,020
So it's hours2.py.

36
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,900
And so now we have
the-- I'll keep

37
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,010
that in-- rate and the hours.

38
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,500
I'll put that print
statement back in.

39
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,945
And the problem is I can't just
do pay equals rate times hours.

40
00:01:58,945 --> 00:02:00,740
So I need an if, then, else.

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,490
So let's do an if.

42
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:08,220
If the hours is less than
40, then we can say pay

43
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,960
equals rate times hours.

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,979
That's fine.

45
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,465
So now let's come up-- I
need to add four spaces.

46
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:16,702

47
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:18,650
Here we go.

48
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,102
I could write another
statement, say it like this.

49
00:02:22,102 --> 00:02:24,060
Actually, this should be
less than or equal 40.

50
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,240

51
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,970
If pay is greater
than 40, we can

52
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,540
get a different calculation.

53
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,315
And that one is pay.

54
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:40,151

55
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:41,650
There's a couple
of ways to do this,

56
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,280
but I'm going to do it this way.

57
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,090
Rate times 40, which
means those are the hours.

58
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:48,685
That's your basic rate.

59
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:54,059
Then I'm going to
add rate times 1.5.

60
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:55,600
That's one and a
half times the rate.

61
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:01,720
Times-- and then the hours above
40-- which is hours minus 40.

62
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,160
So this bit here is
the hours above 40.

63
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,010
Now, operator
precedence would say

64
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,650
that these multiplications are
done before this subtraction.

65
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,540
And that might not work so well.

66
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,490
So let's go ahead and run
this and see what happens.

67
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,410
So we got pay is
rate times hours.

68
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,515
And pay is equal to rate times
1.5 times hours minus 40.

69
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:29,220
So let's go ahead and run this.

70
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,150
I got Python hours.

71
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:40,950

72
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,587
Let's do 30 hours and $10.

73
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:44,420
That's looking good.

74
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,822

75
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:50,330
Now that's running through
this bit of code right here.

76
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,980

77
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,690
And let's do exactly 40 hours.

78
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,160
And that's looking good.

79
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,510
So let's do 50 hours, because we
can calculate that in our head.

80
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,175
That's 10 hours extra.

81
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:13,220
And then a rate of
$10 should be 500.

82
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,150
That doesn't seem right.

83
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,255
So 50 times 10.

84
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,839

85
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,680
What's wrong here?

86
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,810
50 times 10.

87
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:28,700

88
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,855
If hours is less than 40.

89
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:36,090

90
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,390
I'm confused.

91
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,210
What's wrong with this?

92
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,500
Well, whoops.

93
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,580
What did I do here?

94
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,160
If pay is greater than 40.

95
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,040
That does not seem right.

96
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,785
Did I save this file?

97
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:53,570
I'm crazy.

98
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,640
50 hours.

99
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,430
$10 an hour.

100
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,095
Oh, OK.

101
00:04:57,095 --> 00:05:00,700
I must not have saved the file.

102
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:06,960
So pay is not defined on Line 8.

103
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,170
Oops, I was typing too fast.

104
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:14,450
That needs to be
hours greater than 40.

105
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,450
So that's better.

106
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,990
So now we have hours less than
40 and hours greater than 40.

107
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,240
So let's run that one again.

108
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,770
50 hours at $10 an hour.

109
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,420

110
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,290
50 hours at $10 an hour.

111
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,570
That would be like
600 and something.

112
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,660
This does not look
like the right number.

113
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:47,030

114
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,700
And so I want to just
take this print back out.

115
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,560
Print rate and hour.

116
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,340
Save that.

117
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,170
Let's run it again.

118
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,800
50 hours.

119
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,670
$10 per hour.

120
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,980
$1,100.

121
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,710
That does not look right.

122
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:06,960
So let's take a look at this.

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,120

124
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,610
Rate times 40.

125
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,160
That's pretty obvious.

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
That would be $400.

127
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,200
Rate times one and a half.

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:20,590
That would be $15 times the
number of hours minus 40.

129
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,720
Oh.

130
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,670
So this is an operator
precedence problem.

131
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:31,930
So if you recall, multiplication
happens before addition.

132
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:37,370
And so Python is going to
do this calculation first.

133
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,965
This is the actual calculation.

134
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,620
Because we're
multiplying the rate

135
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:45,140
times one and a half times
the number of hours, and then

136
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,355
it's subtracting 40.

137
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:48,680
This ends up being a
rather large number,

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,625
and that's how our
calculation is wrong.

139
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,320
That is not how we
meant to do this.

140
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,350
Oops.

141
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,480
So let's put parentheses
in because we

142
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,290
want to subtract
40 from the hours

143
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,140
before we do the multiplication.

144
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,180
We want this to happen first.

145
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,840
We want the hours
to subtract to 40,

146
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,340
so then they'll end
up with 10 hours

147
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,040
and then multiply
that by the rate.

148
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,510
So let me save that and run it.

149
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,800
50 hours.

150
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,930
$10 an hour.

151
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,120
$550.

152
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,930
Much better.

153
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,190
Much better.

154
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:24,660
That looks pretty much better.

155
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,590
So we're done with that.

156
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,170
We had that little mistake there
of the parenthesis not working.

157
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,010
And the other thing is is
that the much better way

158
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:37,140
to write this is just
putting an else here.

159
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,719
So we just say else.

160
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,260
And so now we have
an if, then, else.

161
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,435
If it's less than or
equal to 40, we do this.

162
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,289
If it's greater
than 40, we do that.

163
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:46,330
And then we do print pay.

164
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,530
So let's save that one.

165
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,180

166
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,270
So 50 hours, $10 an hour, $550.

167
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,200
So this if, then,
else formulation

168
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,400
is a much better way to do
this particular problem.
