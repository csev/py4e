00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,667
Hi, I'm Arnold from
Manila in the Philippines.

3
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:06,250
And I'm first got
into MOOCs because I

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,460
wanted to learn some
college-level math--

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,700
specifically probability, linear
algebra, calculus, statistics,

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,650
that kind of thing.

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,970
It's true that a MOOC
class can't replace

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,030
a class in a real
college, but in my case

9
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,640
I already have a
college education

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,200
and I'm actually using MOOCs
to fill in the gaps left behind

11
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,430
by my very qualitative degree
in the social sciences.

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:32,290
Along the way, I discovered
IHDS, which looked interesting,

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,320
and it was interesting.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,236
It was basic enough for
me to be able to learn

15
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:38,260
a little bit about
computers and the internet,

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,660
and it was actually
interesting enough

17
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,470
for me to want to take a
course in programming Python

18
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,890
afterwards.

19
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,500
That was six months ago.

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,840
In a span of six months, I
think I've come pretty far.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,900
I've learned enough to be
able to attend my local Python

22
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,810
conference and be able to
follow along with what everyone

23
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,870
was talking about.

24
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,060
These are all computer science
graduates are professionals,

25
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,430
and I consider it an achievement
that in the span of six months

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,540
I could go there and be
able to mix with the crowd.

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,790
MOOCs to me are an investment.

28
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,569
I'm taking a lot of them right
now, math and computer science

29
00:01:16,569 --> 00:01:17,235
and programming.

30
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:20,340
I actually left my job two
months ago to focus on MOOCs,

31
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,330
and that's because
it's actually hoping

32
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,390
to make a little bit
of a career change.

33
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,390
Well, more of a shift
in career trajectory

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,120
towards more quantitatively
oriented side of things.

35
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,370
I actually hope to work
in the development sector.

36
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,580
I admire the work of
organizations like the Abdul

37
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:40,585
Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab,
those randomized control trials

38
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:43,800
in developing countries to see
the impact of social programs.

39
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,652
And I think it's fair to say
that without MOOCs I wouldn't

40
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:49,360
have had the opportunity
to learn to kind

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,360
of quantitative skills
I need to even consider

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,210
working in a setting like that.

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,110
So that's my story.
