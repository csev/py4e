1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,550
Hello and welcome
to my short video

3
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:07,770
on using the AutoGrader that
I built for Python associated

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:09,430
with my pythonlearn.com.

5
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,020
That's my free and
open book-- Python

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,220
for Informatics,
Exploring Information.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,460
Of course, the book is available
in PDF and EPUB and iBooks

8
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,885
and HTML.

9
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,130
And it's a free book.

10
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,080
That's how these things work.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,660
So let me go back here.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,480
I'm here to talk
about the AutoGrader.

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,850
The AutoGrader is open source.

14
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,380
If you're a teacher
yourself, you

15
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,010
can download a copy
of the AutoGrader

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,210
and use it in your own course.

17
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,140
You'd have to configure
it to teach it

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,010
the questions that you want
and the answers that you want.

19
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,420
I haven't got that
documented yet

20
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,810
but the source code is
pretty straightforward

21
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,196
if you're a teacher.

22
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:53,380
So there's a couple
ways you can do it.

23
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,360
If you just go to it as a
website-- as a hosted website--

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,680
it does great.

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,820
So here's just a few that
I've got all put up some

26
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,510
more pretty soon I'll start
with just the hello world

27
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,150
assignment.

28
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,277
And so the basic idea is you've
got a problem statement here.

29
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:14,110
I want to change that
color to make it green

30
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,470
or something so it's
a little more obvious.

31
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:17,750
Write a program that uses
a print statement to say

32
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,420
"hello world," as shown below.

33
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,890
So here's the desired
output that we have.

34
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,340
And here is the output
of your program.

35
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,780
And this window here
is a text window

36
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,020
that you can type whatever
it is that you want to type

37
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,600
and then run the Python.

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,230
So if you press the
Check Code button,

39
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,050
it compiles it and runs it.

40
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:42,230
But this is complaining
because I have a syntax error.

41
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:47,120
And so if you look, this
sample code has a mistake.

42
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,320
It should be print
"hello world."

43
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,227
And then when I
check it, it works.

44
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:56,810
And part of it, it
checks to make sure

45
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,720
that the output of your
program matches the output

46
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,500
of the other program.

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,250
I could make a
successful program

48
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,160
and it would show you that there
was a mismatch on that line.

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,731
And so it's pretty smart.

50
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:14,230
Now, this Done
button may or may not

51
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,390
appear whoever's calling it.

52
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:17,890
If you embed it in
your own website,

53
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,090
you can control where this
Done button goes back to

54
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,920
or if it even appears
or not, but I've

55
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,000
got to go back in this
thing to go back to my list.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,560

57
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,120
So here's one that it
also can open files.

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,660
I've got it to the point where
it always opens the files

59
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,250
unbox-short.txt.

60
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,750
If you're doing it
yourself, you can

61
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,170
teach it to open more files.

62
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,880
This one will run.

63
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,800
The desired output
is 1910 Lines.

64
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,930
Here's an open and a
read loop and a print.

65
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:52,380
So if you run it, it runs
it and you can finish it.

66
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,560
So you can put things in.

67
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,531
It is not my goal to have
this be your development

68
00:02:58,531 --> 00:02:59,030
environment.

69
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,821
I want you to develop
on your own computer,

70
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:02,880
but this is really
for turning it in.

71
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,930
Now, I want to show you how this
can also be used in a course.

72
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:09,620
This is my online
course, and I'm

73
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,840
going to go into my
Python playground, which

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,260
is an instance of Moodle.

75
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,720
And so here's Moodle.

76
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,190
It's based on this same book.

77
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,100
It's got some YouTube
lectures and discussion forums

78
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,240
in the textbook.

79
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,160
And then I have some
assignments that can be graded.

80
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,950
So I'm going to say, turn in
the hello world assignment.

81
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,190
And so here we go.

82
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,030
We're back into
this user interface.

83
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,240
And if I check my code again,
it says bad input on line one

84
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,010
and it's made the
same mistake just

85
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,850
to sort of the teaching thing.

86
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,650
So check the code.

87
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,110
Now, you see
something different.

88
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,010
Because it's been launched
with IMS Learning Tools

89
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,530
interoperability,
it has the ability

90
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,370
to send a grade back to
Moodle-- the Moodle that I'm

91
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,650
logged in from.

92
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,700
And so it is allowing me as a
student to send a grade back,

93
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,190
and so it just sent a
grade back to Moodle.

94
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,270
It gives the student the
option to submit the grade.

95
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,830
And then if I go
back into Moodle,

96
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,210
you will see that I now
have a grade for that one.

97
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,710
Let's go see if a
can do problem 2.2.

98
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,820
I hope it's really problem
2.2 Go to problem 2.2.

99
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,006
What is this?

100
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:20,771
Oh, prompt the user that
uses raw input-- write

101
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:22,770
a program that uses raw
input to prompt the user

102
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,610
and welcome them.

103
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,636
OK, let's check it.

104
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:30,990

105
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,050
So let's check it.

106
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:41,290
Now, this raw input is actually
popping up the alert box here.

107
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,770
So I'll type Sarah and
it got data mismatched.

108
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,770
So that's not good.

109
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,224
Sarah.

110
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,390
Oh, I can't even type Sarah.

111
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:54,770

112
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,450
There we go.

113
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:05,075
Oh, but I need to say-- I
need to print "hello Sarah."

114
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:07,284
Check code.

115
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:08,700
Oh, that's going
to blow up again.

116
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,850

117
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,240
Sarah is not defined.

118
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,550
And it's got a mismatch.

119
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,450
All kinds of bad things
are happening here.

120
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,260
Hello name.

121
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,236

122
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:24,735
Sarah.

123
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:28,020

124
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,090
Now it should work.

125
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,050
Now I can submit the grade.

126
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,180
So before I submit the grade,
let me show you something

127
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,510
that it does.

128
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,330
I could possibly try to trick
this by saying "hello Sarah"

129
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,610
and only producing this output.

130
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,974
So here, we're
going to finish it.

131
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,140
And at the output's going
to match, but it's saying,

132
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,090
you've got to use
the raw input here

133
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,720
because that's part of the
program specifications.

134
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,170
So that sort of complains.

135
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,720
So there are some sanity
checks on the code

136
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,360
you write to make
sure that you're

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,740
at least doing some
basic things according

138
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,450
to the specifications.

139
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,700
So let me do it one more time.

140
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,230

141
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,480
Sarah.

142
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,600
And now it works, and now
I can submit my grade.

143
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,690
So I submit my grade
back to Moodle.

144
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:20,200
I go back to Moodle and I go
down and I check my grades.

145
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,940
And now I've got two of
the assignments completed.

146
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:28,460
So that gives you a
sense of the AutoGrader.

147
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,220
If you go to pythonlearn.com,
the source code

148
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,800
is available to this.

149
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,160
And so people who actually
want to use it in their classes

150
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,680
can adapt this AutoGrader
for themselves.

151
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,910
And I really need
to give a shout out

152
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,710
to SKULPT, which
is the thing that

153
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,440
really makes this practical.

154
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,470
It's a Python
in-browser compiler,

155
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,480
which means I don't have
to use a server at all.

156
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,540
These pages are
just PHP pages that

157
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,184
do all the work in JavaScript.

158
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:56,350
And so you don't need a lot
of server infrastructure

159
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:56,860
to do this.

160
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,810
And so that is really
quite exciting.

161
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,850
And so thank you for listening.

162
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,840
And I hope you can either
make use of these things

163
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,840
in PythonLearn or
my online courses

164
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,930
that I'll be teaching
using this technique.

165
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,480
Thanks.
