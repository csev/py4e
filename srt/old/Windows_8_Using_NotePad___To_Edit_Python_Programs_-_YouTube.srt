00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,911

2
00:00:00,911 --> 00:00:01,410
Hello.

3
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,860
Welcome to my video on how
to run Python on Windows.

4
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,440
I'm Charles
Severance, and this is

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,220
my book Python For
Informatics and I

6
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,470
have a bunch of free courses.

7
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:12,840
The book is free.

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:18,140
And so I hope you enjoy
learning how to program.

9
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,640
So the first thing
we're going to do

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,970
is download some software.

11
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,440
You need a programmer editor.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,460
And so Notepad Plus
Plus is a good one.

13
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,870
It has syntax highlighting
and other things

14
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,340
and it doesn't
mess up your files.

15
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:34,660
It understands that you
just want a plain text file.

16
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,690
So I'm going to download
and install this.

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,510
You want to be an
administrator when you're

18
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,920
doing this in your Windows box.

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,554
I'm an administrator on
my particular Windows box.

20
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:46,220
Going to run it.

21
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,930

22
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,100
And you might get prompted
for a password here,

23
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,930
but I'm just going to say yes
because I am the administrator.

24
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,280
And I'll run through the
installation process here.

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,630

26
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,760
So that's all done.

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,790
I'm not going to bother
running it right now.

28
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,230
So there we go.

29
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,910
So I've done a Notepad.

30
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,941
The next thing I want to do is
I'm going to download Python.

31
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:12,440
It's here.

32
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,773
I'm at the Python download page.

33
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,410
For my class, I use Python 2.7.

34
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,489
You could use Python 3.

35
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:20,030
They're slightly
different languages.

36
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,690
I think it's fine to learn both
languages although we're really

37
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,770
at the point where
increasingly people are

38
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:26,960
starting to use Python 3.

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,970
But there's so many things
that are there for Python 2.

40
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,080
So the question often asked is,
like, which one of these two?

41
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,540
Do I go x86 or the non?

42
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,710
It's pretty safe to do this one.

43
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:46,600
But-- so if I go Start
and then I type pc info,

44
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,710
this will tell me
something about this PC.

45
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:51,510
Different versions of Windows
have this in different places.

46
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,970
But basically, I
get to the point

47
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,960
where it says I have a system
type 64-bit operating system.

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,000
So I can get a 64-bit
download, which is nice to do.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,540
So I will go back
to Control Panel.

50
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:11,210
And I'm going to download
my windows 64-bit installer.

51
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,399
And I'm going to run it.

52
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,565
And again, I'm going to
need to be an administrator.

53
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:18,067
I'm going to install
for all users.

54
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:19,650
I'm going to leave
it in the directory

55
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,760
that it wants to put
it on my local drive.

56
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,855
Python 2.7-- you can
put it elsewhere,

57
00:02:23,855 --> 00:02:25,730
but then you're going
to have to remember it.

58
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,230
Please don't put spaces in the
path no matter what you do.

59
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,750

60
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,376
And again, I'm the super user.

61
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:33,375
So I'm going to say yes.

62
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,130

63
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,990
So we're all done.

64
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,930
OK, so now, I'm going to
minimize my web browser.

65
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,570
So the next thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to run Notepad.

66
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,350
And of course, you
could have shortcuts.

67
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,120
But I'm going to use
the Start button.

68
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,440
I'm going to hit Start and I'm
going to type in my keyboard

69
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,250
notepad, N-O-T-E-P-A-D.
And up comes Notepad Plus.

70
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,530
And I will take that.

71
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,050
So here, we have Notepad Plus.

72
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,540
And I'm going to right a
simple Python program--

73
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,445
print "hello world".

74
00:03:09,445 --> 00:03:12,060

75
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,190
OK, and I'm going to save this.

76
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,450
So I'm going to
say File, Save As.

77
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,880
And I'm going to put
this on my desktop.

78
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,717
I could make a folder.

79
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:22,800
Sure, let's make a folder.

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,330

81
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,060
Call this Learn because
I'm Python learning.

82
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,400
So I'm going to the folder.

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,540
You'll notice the folder
showed up as soon as I made it.

84
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,914
Now I'm going to make this file.

85
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:39,330
I'm going to call
it firstprog.py.

86
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,525

87
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:46,640
Now, you'll notice it
did syntax coloring.

88
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,780
As soon as it realizes
that this is a .py file,

89
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,310
it knows the Python language.

90
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,400
And so it's giving me some help.

91
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,200
And if I go into
Learn, I will see

92
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,020
that there is indeed sitting
in this folder a file called

93
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,240
firstprog.py.

94
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,690
Unfortunately, Windows hides
the .py but shows us this little

95
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,960
Python icon.

96
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,590
You can run it by
clicking on this

97
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,990
but this is not my preferred
way of running it, OK?

98
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,870
So I'm just going
to minimize that.

99
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,760
And I'm going to say start.

100
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,560
And then I'm going to type CMD.

101
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,790
This is the command prompt.

102
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,520
Sometimes you have to do Start
Run CMD on really old versions

103
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,260
of Windows, or just
Start CMD, and then

104
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,700
run the command prompt.

105
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,140
And this will initially
seem, like, why am I using

106
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,830
this old school command prompt?

107
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,340
But after a while,
part of the goal

108
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,800
is to really get to be
good at your computer

109
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,854
and knowing how
the computer works.

110
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:44,020
So this is the command
prompt and you type commands.

111
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:46,270
So one of the command
you can type is dir.

112
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,580
You're in your home directory.

113
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,350
That's what
[? user.csv ?] means.

114
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,540
And I'm going to go into
my desktop with the CD,

115
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,290
which stands for Change
Directory-- D-E-S-K-T-O-P.

116
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,870
Now I'm in my desktop.

117
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,120
Move my little cursor there.

118
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,230
And I do a dir and you'll see
a whole series of things there.

119
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,330
And then you'll see this
Learn folder-- L-E-A-R-N.

120
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,540
So I'm going to change into
that directory-- CD Learn--

121
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,810
and do a dir there.

122
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,600
And lo and behold, I see exactly
what I was seeing in here.

123
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,220
So this is really
just a graphical image

124
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,600
of what's in that folder.

125
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,750
I mean, and you can even sort
of see the path if you look here

126
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,300
that it's in MySQL and
[? user/csev/desktop/learn, ?]

127
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,910
which is exactly
where I'm at-- SQL

128
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,326
and
[? user/csev/desktop/learn. ?]

129
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:31,230

130
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,660
This may see-- when you start
reading and writing files,

131
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,050
it's important that you put
your files in the same folder

132
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,620
here as the program.

133
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,250
So to run the Python program,
you simply type firstprog.py.

134
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,570
It's as if-- whoops,
F-I-R-S-T-P-R-O-G.py.

135
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,580

136
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,900
It's as if you build an
extension of the system.

137
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,030
The little program
you wrote in Python

138
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,460
is sitting there for you to run.

139
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:07,120
And I can make a change
like something else

140
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,690
and save that file.

141
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,370
And then I can run it again.

142
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,470
Now, here's a trick.

143
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,930
I can hit the up arrow and just
run the same program again.

144
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,190

145
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,270
Syntax error-- PR.

146
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,370
Oh, I put an M in.

147
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,620
Print, Save.

148
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,970
Now I just come back here.

149
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,330
I hit up arrow and run it again.

150
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,260
And so now I have my
old two line program.

151
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,340
And away it goes.

152
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,300
So the only other
thing to know is

153
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,370
to how to start
Python for the command

154
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,060
so you can do interactive
playing with Python.

155
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,900
And this way, you can
type Python commands.

156
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,685
And you can add it to your
path and go look on Google

157
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:50,920
as to how to add
something your path.

158
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,090
But it's easier just
to say C:/python27

159
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,930
because that's where we--
oops, python27/python.

160
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:04,350

161
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,000
I cannot type.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,330

163
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,190
And so this is the
chevron prompt, right?

164
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,790
There's the chevron prompt.

165
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:19,780
So I can type a print
yo or I can type

166
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:26,070
take me to your Python leader.

167
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,000
Syntax error-- yeah, we've
been through this before.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,820
I hate computers.

169
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,034
OK, so you get out.

170
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:35,450
But here, you've
got to be careful

171
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,790
because you can't run programs.

172
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,797
And so you can type
quit to get out.

173
00:07:39,797 --> 00:07:41,505
And now you're back
at the command prompt

174
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:43,030
and you can type dir.

175
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,640
So you can learn
the commands here.

176
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,750
All we really know
is we know dir, CD.

177
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,790
And when in doubt, just
close this window If you get

178
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,300
lost in the wrong
folder or something.

179
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,180
So that's pretty much
all I wanted to do.

180
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,190
Please don't make directory
names or folder names

181
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,370
with spaces in.

182
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,460
It just makes life confusing.

183
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,950
So stick with simple names.

184
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,060
Don't put long spaces
in either folder names

185
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,630
or file names because then it's
harder to do this stuff, OK?

186
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,992
Thanks.

187
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:14,492
