00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499

2
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:02,730
Hello and welcome to
Python for Informatics.

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,370
I'm Charles Severance.

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,454
And I'm the teacher
for the course.

5
00:00:06,454 --> 00:00:08,370
So I always like start,
when I teach a course,

6
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,180
and talk about who
should take the course.

7
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,540
And I have written this book.

8
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,090
And I'm teaching this
course with the notion

9
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,460
that everybody should
know some programming.

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,180
Not necessarily that
everyone is supposed

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,010
to be a computer scientist
or professional programmer,

12
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,534
but I really believe that
everyone should understand

13
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:28,950
this world that
we live in, that's

14
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,570
increasingly full of gadgets
that have microprocessors

15
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,256
in them and displays.

16
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:38,200
And I think it helps
us understand our world

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,350
and make sense of it, to
know a little something

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,800
about programming.

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,647
And most of the jobs that you're
ever going to get these days

20
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,730
are going to have something
to do with technology.

21
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,140
And so just a little
understanding.

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,492
You may become curious, and
you may want to learn more.

23
00:00:51,492 --> 00:00:53,700
And you may want to learn
about the web and databases

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,650
and all kinds of things.

25
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,370
But right now I just want to
give you a basic understanding

26
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,900
of how things work.

27
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,460
I'd be real happy if
we made you curious.

28
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,030
So I always like to start,
talk a little bit about myself,

29
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,697
so you know who I am.

30
00:01:08,697 --> 00:01:10,155
I am at the University
of Michigan,

31
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:12,690
and I'm a clinical
associate professor.

32
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,770
And you can follow
me on Twitter.

33
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,070
I generally don't friend
students on Facebook

34
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,760
until long after
they've graduated

35
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,210
and if they're really friends.

36
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,945
So don't do that.

37
00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:24,320
But you can follow
me on Twitter.

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,260
I do like Twitter.

39
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,390
I have all kinds of stuff
on Flickr and other places.

40
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,990
And I live my life
pretty openly.

41
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,090
And so you can see
what's going on.

42
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,850
I have a long history
in computer programming.

43
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,000
I was one of the leaders of
the Sakai open source learning

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,540
management system that
some of you may have used.

45
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,590
Some of you may have used
Moodle, the other open source

46
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,190
learning management system.

47
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,120
Teaching and learning with
technology is my research area.

48
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,269
And prior to that,
I was a guy that

49
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:54,560
did high-performance computing.

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,976
That was my research
area as well.

51
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:58,220
And I have hobbies of
off-road motorcycling.

52
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,880
And I play hockey every week.

53
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,830
You can see a little
picture of me there.

54
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,280
And the one year that
we won the playoffs,

55
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,410
and you see that I'm somewhere
in there wearing a cast.

56
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,140
I broke this finger during
the hockey playoffs.

57
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,162
And I didn't want to get
it cast until-- I broke it

58
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:18,230
in the semi finals--
and I didn't want

59
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,550
to let go until the finals.

60
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,120
So I played the final with
a broken finger, and we won.

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,540
And that's the cup
that I'm holding there.

62
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,160
And then I got my finger cast.

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,580
Another thing-- like I said,
I've worked on Sakai a lot.

64
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,370
And I have even had
the audacity to write

65
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,330
a book about that experience.

66
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,380
Open source is a very
passion-provoking thing.

67
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,110
And it's really quite wonderful.

68
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,620
And so that's my tattoo.

69
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,030
You see the Sakai tattoo.

70
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,140
It's on the book.

71
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:50,030
It's a real, live tattoo.

72
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,140
And as a matter of fact,
since I finished as the lead--

73
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,090
I still work on Sakai.

74
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,220
I'm just not in
charge anymore-- I

75
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,050
put a ring of tattoos of
all the different learning

76
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,550
management systems-- Blackboard,
Desire2Learn, Canvas, Moodle--

77
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,880
all the ones that
implement the standard

78
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,790
that I helped promulgate.

79
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,760
IMS Learning Tools
Interoperability.

80
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,760
And it is actually featured
throughout this class.

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,560
It's how we plug
things together.

82
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,170
You might see things flashing
by that LTI in the URL.

83
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,810
And that's because
of this standard

84
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:28,550
that I spent four years of my
life trying to get adopted.

85
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,550
And it has been adopted.

86
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,460
I'm really pretty proud of that.

87
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,130
And then sort of one
last silly thing.

88
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,470
You may have met me already
without even knowing it.

89
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,720
I did a project where I had
students do viral videos.

90
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,100
And I try to do a
viral video myself.

91
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,590
And so I did this iPad
steering wheel mount.

92
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,990
It caused a lot of people to
put a lot of mean comments

93
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,780
about me, about how what
smart-- or not so smart--

94
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,870
guy I really am.

95
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,440
So feel free to
take a look at that.

96
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,360
I have a sense of humor.

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,020
I hope that you figured
that out by now.

98
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,850
I didn't set out, when I was
young, to be a programmer.

99
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,380
I'm older than most of you.

100
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,810
Not necessarily all of you,
but older than most of you.

101
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,490
And back when I
was in high school,

102
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,690
the notion of programming
as an avocation

103
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,790
was rather rare thing.

104
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,579
And I was a pretty
smart guy, knew my way

105
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,880
around mathematics and
physics and things like that.

106
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,060
And I went to college in
1975, in the fall of 1975.

107
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,540
And the adviser said, hey,
take this programming class.

108
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,165
We're putting all
the freshmen into it.

109
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:33,790
And so in I go.

110
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,390
And they put me in this class.

111
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,230
And this class started at
an outrageously early time.

112
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,700
It was 10:30 in the morning.

113
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,272
And I was enjoying myself
greatly and playing

114
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:48,020
a lot of video games.

115
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,530
That was when you actually went
someone to play video games,

116
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,250
rather than play video
games at your house.

117
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,666
And I was really
enjoying collage.

118
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,990
And I figured out that
you could skip class,

119
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,604
and no one would care.

120
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:59,020
And so I skipped,
started skipping

121
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,630
lot of these really early
10:30 in the morning classes.

122
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,565
And at one point about halfway
through the semester, I walk in

123
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:06,190
and they're handing
out pieces of paper

124
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,780
with a midterm exam on it.

125
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,340
And I look at this
piece of paper,

126
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,000
and apparently I
missed a lot of class,

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,960
because almost none of the
words made any sense to me.

128
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,930
Somehow, that sort of shocked
me into actually going to class.

129
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:21,190
And I picked up
quickly after that.

130
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,320
I really learned that
programming was not

131
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,530
so much about trying
to please the computer,

132
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,730
but instead the computer
would do anything I wanted.

133
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,690
If I would just learn
its simple language

134
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,870
and explain to it in its simple
language what I wanted done,

135
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,460
that it would dutifully
go off and do whatever

136
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,170
it is that I wanted.

137
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,575
And so I became a prodigy in
the second half of this class.

138
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:45,600
And I got all the
programming caught up.

139
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,710
And I did extra assignments
and did all these cool things.

140
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,675
And at the end of the
class, I got a D. I got a D.

141
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:56,710
But then I changed my
major to computer science.

142
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,910
And I really enjoyed it.

143
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,910
It's been a great
profession for me.

144
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,150
But I understand.

145
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,850
I understand how you may
be a little bit confused

146
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,100
as you're learning this.

147
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,380
And so I really understand
it as I go through this.

148
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,720
And I really built this book
and this course-- this book

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,280
and this course--
to address those who

150
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,890
might be a little bit nervous.

151
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,350
I give you lots of
recorded videos, et cetera.

152
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,700
So let's talk a little
bit about the course.

153
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,670
The book that I
just mentioned is

154
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,839
called Python for Informatics,
Exploring Information.

155
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,880
It's a book that I wrote.

156
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,960
I wrote specifically to
be different than most

157
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,290
of the first programming
books that you'll pick up.

158
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:37,250
A lot of computer scientists
see computer science

159
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,050
and programming as
applied mathematics.

160
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,020
And when you get into
advanced programming,

161
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,270
you certainly have to
have a really strong grasp

162
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,080
of mathematics for
a lot of reasons.

163
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,730
But you don't need so much
mathematics in the beginning.

164
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:51,800
So this book is actually adapted
from another computer science

165
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,635
book that was a free and
open book that I adapted.

166
00:06:54,635 --> 00:06:56,005
But I took the math out.

167
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:59,170
I took the math out, and
I put in all about data.

168
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,452
And that's why I call
Exploring Information.

169
00:07:02,452 --> 00:07:03,550
It's free.

170
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,785
You can download as HTML.

171
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:06,450
You can download it as a PDF.

172
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,800
You can download it on iBooks.

173
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,540
You can download
it on ePub reader.

174
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,750
I've got that version.

175
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,590
You go to www.PythonLearn.com.

176
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,390
And it's all free.

177
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,140
Because of some little
bits of complexity,

178
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,115
I can't sell a paper
copy of this book yet.

179
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:21,990
At some point, I've got
to rewrite a few more

180
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,110
chapters of it to be
completely belonging to me.

181
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,762
And then I can actually
sell a printed copy.

182
00:07:27,762 --> 00:07:29,845
But for now it's actually
only available to people

183
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:32,400
who can somehow make it
to Ann Arbor, Michigan,

184
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,060
and buy it from our library.

185
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,970
So one of the theories of
this book and this course

186
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,825
is open content.

187
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:43,370

188
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,610
My book is free.

189
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,480
My book is remixable.

190
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,780
My lecture slides are
Creative Commons Attribution.

191
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:52,340
My recorded videos are
sitting there on YouTube.

192
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,820
You can use them
any way you like.

193
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,480
Or use them inside the
context of my class,

194
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,070
inside the context
of your class.

195
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,530
Use them as a study guide.

196
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,120
I really don't care.

197
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,060
The videos are Creative
Commons with attribution.

198
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,540
And all the software
that I'm using

199
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,750
for this class--
both the online code

200
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,492
and the Moodle and the Sakai
that I'm using in the class--

201
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,700
it's all open source as well.

202
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,040
And when I finish the course,
each time I finish it,

203
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,370
I will make a zip
file or a backup file

204
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,510
from Moodle and
Common Cartridge,

205
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,030
to the point where if you
have a Moodle or a Sakai,

206
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,830
you can load this stuff
into-- or even Blackboard

207
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,690
or Desire2Learn-- you
should be able to load

208
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,159
this stuff in and
then remix the course

209
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,530
to your own satisfaction.

210
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:43,090
And the reason is is that to
me these large scale courses,

211
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,780
everyone's so excited
about how many students are

212
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,640
these large scale
courses, and somehow

213
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,220
that these students are going
to take the course from me.

214
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,760
And I become
well-known, et cetera.

215
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,250
I really believe that in
the long term, for this

216
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,810
to really change education
in the way that many of us

217
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,610
want to see education
changed, we have to teach

218
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,570
and empower teachers.

219
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,540
And so I'm hopeful that
some of you watching this

220
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,410
are actually teachers and
are going to come in here

221
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,546
and figure out how
to make sense of this

222
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:14,920
and use it in your
own classroom.

223
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,950
I want to empower the
teachers to take this material

224
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,110
and teach with this material
and use me as a supplement

225
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,040
to their own teaching, rather
than me doing all the teaching.

226
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,880
I think that all
these things need

227
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,870
to be localized to
different cultures,

228
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,440
different cultural references,
different examples,

229
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,170
different languages.

230
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,300
Just merely translating
parts of things

231
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,800
into a different language--
just not to me satisfactory.

232
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,940
And so if you're a
teacher, get a hold of me.

233
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,650
In the early days,
I might even want

234
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,760
to have you teach on my
infrastructure to test it out.

235
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,800
Part of this is for me
to build the cool stuff

236
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,520
and see what everyone thinks,
what works, what doesn't work.

237
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,950
So this to me is the
learning activity

238
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,010
in the kind of ways we use
technology to enhance learning,

239
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,400
is a curiosity to me.

240
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,050
And whether you're
a teacher or not,

241
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,760
I'm always curious about how
effective this is working

242
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,300
and how it can be improved.

243
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,990
Because I think we
should all come up

244
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,810
with a way to help each
other teach better.

245
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,230
So the Python that
we're teaching

246
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,210
is-- there's two
versions of Python.

247
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,360
One is Python 3.

248
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,100
It's the newest and the latest.

249
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,540
But it's not completely
widely adopted yet.

250
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,384
And so we still use
the old Python 2.

251
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:29,800
I don't really
apologize for that,

252
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,270
because most of the industry
is still using Python 2.

253
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,367
And Python 3 is just there.

254
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,450
And people are slowly but
surely converting to it.

255
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,220
But it was designed as
a many-year transition,

256
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,470
where both Python 2 and
Python 3 would continue.

257
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:46,487
So I mentioned that the
course that we're teaching

258
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,320
is going to use some
pretty cool technology.

259
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,420
And it's all open source.

260
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,000
And if you look at
the URLs, you can

261
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,290
find where the source
to all this stuff is.

262
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,200
Figure all this out.

263
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,408
And it's open source, so
you could adapt it or use it

264
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,960
or install it or do whatever.

265
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,250
So the course starts, of
course, with-- unless you're

266
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,370
taking the course on the
Michigan campus, when you'll

267
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,430
start in our CTools
system-- but if you're not

268
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,055
taking the course
from Michigan campus,

269
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:12,010
you start on this kind
of enrollment site,

270
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,330
called Dr. Chuck Online.

271
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,714
Dr. Chuck Online is
where you sign in,

272
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:17,130
where you put your
profile in, you

273
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,940
put your location information.

274
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,550
And then you enroll
in the classes.

275
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:26,230
And then it tracks your overall
progress towards completion.

276
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:30,150
The actual course instruction is
not done with Dr. Chuck Online.

277
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,400
I have a copy of Moodle.

278
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,810
And this is Moodle.

279
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,130
Many of you may have used
Moodle at various places

280
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,120
around the world.

281
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,990
I happen to be using
Moodle because it's

282
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,390
got software that allows me
to connect it into Dr. Chuck

283
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,410
Online most effectively.

284
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,070
I'd like to use not just
Moodle in this situation,

285
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,380
but I'd like to be able to
launch multiple learning

286
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,504
management systems.

287
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:50,170
But you'll go through
Moodle, and you'll

288
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,247
see, for example, that will be
things like a discussion forum,

289
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,830
and then things
you're supposed to do.

290
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,390
An these'll sort of be ordered.

291
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,182
It's kind of like an
outline of the course.

292
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:01,598
Here's what you're
supposed to do.

293
00:12:01,598 --> 00:12:03,840
You're supposed to read
this, take this lecture,

294
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,110
watch this, do this,
turn in the problem.

295
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,990
This is just kind of
a mock-up right now.

296
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,810
As I put the lectures up,
it'll build quite nicely.

297
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,790
Now one of the
interesting things

298
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,170
here is I've got an autograder.

299
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,930
An autograder makes
it so that you

300
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:22,370
can get immediate feedback
on whether your programs are

301
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,410
right or wrong.

302
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,570
So when you click on one
of these autograders,

303
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,670
you actually go into
another program.

304
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:31,120
And so this is the autograder.

305
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,590
And the idea is is that you
are to write a program that

306
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,860
uses raw input to prompt
a user for their name

307
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,120
and welcomes them.

308
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,840
And I'll give you some animated
walk-throughs, so you see this.

309
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,220
The first few I will
show you exactly what

310
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,822
to do, click for click,
so you get used to it.

311
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:49,530
These first few programs
are just simple.

312
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,330
But it's more to get
used to writing a program

313
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,200
and then running it
through the autograder.

314
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,600
And so the idea
is you've written

315
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,679
the program somewhere on
your laptop or your computer.

316
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,720
And you've debugged it
and you've got it working.

317
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,480
And this particular program only
has two lines of Python in it.

318
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,540
It prompts for a name and
then prints the name out.

319
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,730
But you come and then you would
paste in the working program

320
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:10,750
right here.

321
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,850
And then you press
this Check Code button.

322
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,280
Press the Check Code button,
and then it does some thinking.

323
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,250
It runs your code and checks
to see if your output matches

324
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,730
what it's supposed to say.

325
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,420
So this is the output
of your program.

326
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,052
And this is the output that the
program is supposed to produce.

327
00:13:27,052 --> 00:13:29,135
And first it checks to see
if there's any mistakes

328
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:32,230
and gives little notes and
tells you where are mismatching.

329
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,430
And then it finishes.

330
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,475
And you're matched OK.

331
00:13:35,475 --> 00:13:36,979
And that's great.

332
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,770
And then what it does
is it does a few more

333
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,900
checks to see if you're sneaky
or cheating or just whatever.

334
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,910
So it'll give you little notes.

335
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,830
Say, hey, you're supposed
to do this and this.

336
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,730
And you seem to not
use this or that.

337
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,330
Both to catch you and but
also if you miss something,

338
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,317
it might help you.

339
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:58,650
When it's all said and done,
it'll say, congratulations.

340
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,780
The exercise is complete.

341
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,990
Then you press the
Submit Grade button.

342
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,720
And then the grade-- all
the grades are 0 or 1--

343
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,900
it's submitted back to Moodle.

344
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,450
So let me go back here.

345
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,720
So that means that your
grade will come back

346
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,970
into this Moodle.

347
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,599
And if you go down a
little farther down here,

348
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,640
you will see your grades.

349
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,670
And then you'll be able
to immediately check

350
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,330
to see if your grade
has been updated.

351
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:30,576
And inside a Moodle, you
will see a bunch of grades.

352
00:14:30,576 --> 00:14:31,950
And then you'll
see your progress

353
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,580
on each of those grades.

354
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,230
Now the other thing that
happens is that the grade then

355
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,110
moves back up.

356
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,690
It takes 15 minutes for the
grade to make it back here.

357
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,750
But this is kind of like
your overall course progress.

358
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,970
And this little
bar moves across.

359
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,170
This one here says it's one.

360
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,860
And that means
I've completed it.

361
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,694
I've got all the points.

362
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:55,235
Actually that's the
Python playground

363
00:14:55,235 --> 00:14:57,080
that I've got all the points in.

364
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,640
And away you go.

365
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,410
And so that's how it works.

366
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,975
We go from launching
into the course.

367
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:06,820

368
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,460
We do all our learning in here.

369
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,980
We launch into the autograder.

370
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,300

371
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,940
And then we type our program
in here, hit the Check.

372
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,100
And if it says your
exercise is complete,

373
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,620
then the Submit Grade appears.

374
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,880
And then you send your grade.

375
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,463
And the grades work
their way back up.

376
00:15:25,463 --> 00:15:27,470
And at some point, you
pass the class when

377
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,400
you reach the passing
[? grade. ?] Again,

378
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,066
I'm going to come
back and touch on this

379
00:15:31,066 --> 00:15:35,730
and give you some explicit
instructions on how to do this.

380
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,200
There's also a threaded
discussion called Piazza.

381
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,740
This is a code that I'm using
to help threaded discussion.

382
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,270
You can get help from the
other students in the class,

383
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,090
give help.

384
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,240
It's just a place for us to
meet and to talk to each other.

385
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,040
And when you're all done,
you will end up in a map.

386
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,560
And so this is the map, sort of
early before registration map.

387
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,860
We got 121 students
in the class.

388
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:02,270
And here you see all where
all the students are at.

389
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,450
They're all over the place.

390
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,340
We already got students from
all over the world in the class.

391
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,236
We have 121.

392
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:09,110
By the time it starts,
there'll be many more.

393
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,150
You'll be able to see
how many there are.

394
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,000
And these change color.

395
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,160
They start out at green.

396
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,285
And then they move through
sort of pink and yellow.

397
00:16:17,285 --> 00:16:19,220
It's kind of like horse ribbons.

398
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:26,540
So when you are successful,
you will get a blue ribbon.

399
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,020
Culturally, the ribbon color
is not uniform culturally.

400
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,650
But for most
cultures, blue ribbons

401
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,369
are number one and red
ribbons are number two.

402
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:38,785
I think yellow are number
three, and pink are number four.

403
00:16:38,785 --> 00:16:40,570
And green is somewhere
in the bottom.

404
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,460
So basically you can see
this as we all start out

405
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,240
as green when we start.

406
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,840
And then as we make progress,
we go to like things

407
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,730
like yellow and pink.

408
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,961
And then when we've totally
achieved everything,

409
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:54,629
we get a blue.

410
00:16:54,629 --> 00:16:56,170
And so this is the
Python playground,

411
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,690
where people can play.

412
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,640
So it's a lot easier
to get a blue ribbon

413
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,860
in the Python playground.

414
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,700

415
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,190
And so you'll notice I
sort of glossed over this.

416
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,540
There are two classes.

417
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,540
One class is the Python
for Informatics class.

418
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,290
And that is a
structured class where

419
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,550
I will be participating in it
on a daily or weekly basis.

420
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,910
And other students--
and I'm mixing

421
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,280
my off-campus and
on-campus students--

422
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,810
and so it has to
start a certain time,

423
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,630
because I'm using it
both for my off-campus

424
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,920
and on-campus students.

425
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,090
So you'll see another
100 or so students come

426
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,620
in from my on-campus class.

427
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,270
And they'll be going through
it too at the exact same time.

428
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,325
So this is a mixing of
my on-campus students

429
00:17:36,325 --> 00:17:37,450
and my off-campus students.

430
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,680
And I think that's
particularly awesome and cool.

431
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,570
And so if you're going to enroll
in Python for Informatics,

432
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,790
you got to enroll sometime
between January 14 and 28.

433
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:50,260
I'm not going to give
you forever to catch up.

434
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,870
But if you're watching this
sometime other than January 14

435
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,210
to the 20-- and I'll
give the class again

436
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,510
after that-- but the
Python for Informatics

437
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,300
is when I or someone else is
monitoring the class actively.

438
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,650
But if you just want to
go in and do the problems

439
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:09,180
by yourself, as I put the
problems into the Python

440
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,640
for Informatics, I will also put
them in the Python playground.

441
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,970
The Python playground, you
can go in any time you like.

442
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,120
Go as long as you like.

443
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,340
Do it all by yourself.

444
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,560
Earn a blue ribbon.

445
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,179
There you go.

446
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:22,220
You've earned a blue ribbon
in Python playground.

447
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,880
It'll be pretty much the same
as in Python for Informatics.

448
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,850
The difference is
Python for Informatics

449
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,410
is at a given time during
a given time period.

450
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,600
And that's when I'm
going to teach the class.

451
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,397
That's when I'm going
to teach the class.

452
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:37,480
And I hope to have other
teachers teach the class.

453
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,960
And so they can have
their own version of this.

454
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,335
And they can teach it when
they want on whatever schedule

455
00:18:42,335 --> 00:18:43,260
that they want.

456
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,925
And if I get a lot of
students that want to join up,

457
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:47,114
I can open another thing.

458
00:18:47,114 --> 00:18:48,780
And if I get enough
students, maybe I'll

459
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,863
teach it in the middle of
the summer or something.

460
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,370
I can do this any
time, but I want

461
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,030
to make it so that there's
a time for me to focus

462
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:58,420
on the class, to be
in the class with you.

463
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,010
So you can do the
Python playground

464
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,070
anytime starting right now.

465
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,050
And the problems
and the assignments

466
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,410
will be pretty much the same.

467
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,790
You can use the Python
playground to pre-study.

468
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,240
But I don't have it set up yet.

469
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,427
The Python playground will
grow along with the class.

470
00:19:13,427 --> 00:19:15,260
Once I'm done with the
class the first time,

471
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,060
the Python playground will be
the entire and complete class.

472
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,030
And then I might tweak
it each time I teach it.

473
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,636
That's how I
generally do classes.

474
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:24,010
And Python playground
will always

475
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:26,364
have been the last time
I taught the class.

476
00:19:26,364 --> 00:19:28,280
But you will stay in
Python playground forever

477
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,150
and ever and ever.

478
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,950
And all your little
blue ribbons and stuff

479
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,690
will stay forever and
ever in Python playground.

480
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:37,020
Python playground is
set up so that even

481
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,650
if I change the
grading rules, if you

482
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,360
get a blue ribbon in
Python playground,

483
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,510
you can have a blue ribbon
forever and ever and ever.

484
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:49,280
So welcome to the class.

485
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,720
Bring your friends.

486
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,600
I think we will
have a lot of fun.

487
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,210
It's not as sophisticated as
things like Udacity or Coursera

488
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,200
or edX, because I'm it.

489
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,680
I'm writing software.

490
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,660
I'm the teacher.

491
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,130
I'm the everything.

492
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,640
But with great responsibility
comes great flexibility.

493
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,640
And so I am really enjoying and
looking forward to this class.

494
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,570
I'm looking forward
to hearing from you

495
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,440
and the comments you might have
as we go through the class.
