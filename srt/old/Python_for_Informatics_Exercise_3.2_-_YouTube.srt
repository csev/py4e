00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510

00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,330
Welcome to our worked exercise.

3
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:05,940
This is Dr. Charles Severence
and worked exercises

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,885
from Python for Informatics.

on how to install Python or use

7
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:18,460
a text editor in general or
how to use the command line,

8
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,570
stuff that we'll be
using in this exercise,

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,430
go back to
pythonlearn.com and work

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,420
through the
introductory materials.

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,880
So here's our exercise.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,940
We're supposed to
rewrite our pay program.

13
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,430
And we're going to use try
and except in this situation

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,825
so we can handle non
numeric input gracefully.

15
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:37,950
And we're supposed to print
out an error if there's

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,080
any non numeric input
and otherwise print out

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,935
the right thing.

18
00:00:40,935 --> 00:00:41,810
So let's get started.

19
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,660

20
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,660
Let's go ahead and
start Text Wrangler.

21
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,920
And start terminal program.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,320
And make it a little smaller.

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,470
Move it to the bottom.

24
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,060
Make this a little smaller.

25
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:03,859
Get rid of the-- So I'm going
to start with the program

26
00:01:03,859 --> 00:01:05,830
that I've already got written.

27
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:11,620
And so I'll open the last one
I worked with, which is hours2.

28
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,535
And I'm going to save
this quickly as hours3.

29
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:17,770
We programmers do
this all the time.

30
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,210
I mean, why waste typing if
i just got done typing it?

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:21,810
There we go.

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,790
That's why these
exercises build on it

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,475
so you get used to this notion
of just kind of hack and code

34
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:28,500
that you had before.

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,450
OK, so I'll put the print
of rate and hours back in.

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,430
This part from here
down is pretty safe.

37
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,870
So I'll go into my desktop, go
into Python for Informatics,

38
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,960
and say python hours3.

39
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,540

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,210
And I'll say 40,
10-- super duper.

41
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,980
And I say glug, glug, crash.

42
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,290
So where is it blowing up?

43
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,210
Well it's blowing
up on the float.

44
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,340
So the float is the
dangerous thing.

45
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,860
And this is-- this float is
the dangerous thing too, right?

46
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,860
And so this is where
it's going to blow up.

47
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,400
And now because of this, the
rest of the program hasn't run.

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,775
And this is exactly
the situation

49
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:16,310
we're going to use a
try and except for.

50
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,740
OK, so let's do try.

51
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,620
And we're going to
just-- we're going to use

52
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,327
a sledgehammer on this one.

53
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,660
We're going to put all four
of these statements in a try

54
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,320
block.

55
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,450
But only two of the
statements are in some danger.

56
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,970

57
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,590
And in a second, I'll
show you what can go wrong

58
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,120
with this approach.

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,960
But for now, we're
in the beginning.

60
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,150
It'd be E-X-C-E-P-T colon.

61
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,600
And this is where we
put our error message,

62
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:48,280
where we go to print, and
what we're supposed to print.

63
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,300
Let's just kind of steal that.

64
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,800
Error, error-- please
enter a numeric input.

65
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,430
So I just cut and paste that.

66
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:00,900
So now we take an insurance out.

67
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,450
If everything goes well,
this except is ignored.

68
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,220
If anything goes
wrong, and really it's

69
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,136
going to be the floats--
one of the two floats

70
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:11,570
is going to go
wrong-- away it goes.

71
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,615
So let's go ahead and run this.

72
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:16,490
Make this a little bigger.

73
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,697
And I will save it.

74
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:21,810

75
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,330
OK, python hours3.

76
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,200

77
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,740
Let's do it right first.

78
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,475
Looking good-- now
let's do it wrong.

79
00:03:35,475 --> 00:03:38,860

80
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,520
Now, I typed in a bad number.

81
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,610
And it said, error, please
enter numeric input.

82
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,230
But then blew up--
trace back to line nine.

83
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,810
This is line nine right here.

84
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:56,940
Oops-- well, that's because
I didn't tell it to stop.

85
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,590
It just kept on going, right?

86
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,700
And so there's a couple
ways we can solve this.

87
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,650
We could solve it cleanly.

88
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,900
But I'm just going to
be crude at this point.

89
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,485
And I'm going to put all
this stuff in the except.

90
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:20,399

91
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:29,000
Because that way-- oops-- if it
dies, it's going to run this.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,500
And then the program's
going to be done.

93
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,660
And if it succeeds, it's
going to fall through.

94
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,600
And it's only going to do this
code if that other code worked.

95
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,327
And I will show you in
a moment the fallacy

96
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:41,660
and why this isn't the best way.

97
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,530
But this is crude
but effect, right?

98
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,820
We're early on so.

99
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,816
So all we have to do
is find a solution.

100
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:50,730
You bet we'll talk about
what the better solution is.

101
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,680
So here we go-- python hours3.

102
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,760
So we type Fred.

103
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,060
Kaboom, it dies.

104
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,950
So it died on this
line right here.

105
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,380
And then it transferred to
the except and ran this.

106
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,420
And the program was over.

107
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,250
And if we go give a good
one and then something bad,

108
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,290
this line dies and
then it continues on.

109
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,240
So let me show you a
couple of fallacies

110
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,370
or some mistakes in this.

111
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,820
So watch this.

112
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,460
I'm going to make
a mistake here.

113
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:31,080
Print-- I'll say print r,h.

114
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,820
So I'll print r,h.

115
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:40,000
So I'll type python
hours 40 10-- error,

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,700
please enter numeric input.

117
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,140
So what in the
heck was happening?

118
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,410
It's like, it is numeric input.

119
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,292
Where did it die?

120
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:53,500
So what-- I'll tell you what.

121
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,083
I'll just show you
what happened here.

122
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,360
We won't worry too
much about this.

123
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,820
It came into the try.

124
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,190
It did this.

125
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,260
The 40 is good, so that worked.

126
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,730
The rate is good,
so that worked.

127
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,590
What worked was,
r is not defined.

128
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,510
But it turns out that
this is another error.

129
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:11,100
It's just a different error.

130
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,730
It's not the same as this one.

131
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,450
And we just didn't
type it right.

132
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,530
And so it jumps to the except.

133
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,030
It doesn't do any of this code,
but it jumps to the except.

134
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,230
So that's why-- it
was numeric input.

135
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,870
But away we go, OK?

136
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,540
So that's not so good.

137
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,450
You don't really want to put
too much code inside your try

138
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,410
and except.

139
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:34,480
So let's take a look and do
this one a little better.

140
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,940
I'm going to cut this back out.

141
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,800
I'll move it down to
the bottom and now I've

142
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,135
got to deindent it.

143
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:42,020
I'll fix this rate and hours.

144
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:57,970

145
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:11,180
Deindent-- I didn't
get my indents right.

146
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,649
OK, so now my indents are right.

147
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,440
So let me go ahead and
run the program just

148
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,060
to make sure I'm not crazy.

149
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,240
40, 10-- that's good.

150
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,500
50, 10-- that's good.

151
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,900
So I'm good.

152
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,300
OK, so the problem now is I've
reintroduced my error that if I

153
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,744
give it a bad thing--
OK, so let's take a look

154
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,160
at the kinds of
things that we can

155
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,470
do to make this a
little more elegant.

156
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,477
So we're right here.

157
00:07:37,477 --> 00:07:38,310
This is the problem.

158
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,600
We need to stop.

159
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,530
We don't want to
continue at this point.

160
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:49,384
If there was the thing that
we could say, just stop here.

161
00:07:49,384 --> 00:07:53,410
If there was such a thing
in Python, we'd be fine.

162
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,560
But that would be
bad Python syntax.

163
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,316
But there is such
a thing in Python.

164
00:07:57,316 --> 00:08:00,610
If you want to quit your
program, you type quit.

165
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,135
It's a function.

166
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:03,600
We haven't covered
functions yet.

167
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,797
We will soon.

168
00:08:04,797 --> 00:08:06,380
It's a function that
never comes back.

169
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,640
Most functions come back.

170
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,820
But the quit function
does not come back.

171
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,530
So when it comes down
here and it prints this,

172
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,600
the next thing-- and
that doesn't continue.

173
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,900
So this is a way of
saying we are done.

174
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,450
So now let's run this and
put in some bad information.

175
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,050
And it indeed quits.

176
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,914
And so it doesn't
continue down here.

177
00:08:27,914 --> 00:08:29,580
Let's make sure it
works with good data.

178
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,490

179
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,770
Oh, four hours-- well, OK.

180
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,909
I guess that's right.

181
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,880
So let me comment out my
debug print statement here

182
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,890
and finish it up.

183
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,560

184
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,460
We're going to run
it one last time.

185
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,780
Error, please numeric
input-- good hours, bad rate.

186
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,090
That's good.

187
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:56,130
And good hours, good
rate, and that's good.

188
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,100
So we've accomplished this one.
