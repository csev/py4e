1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,390
The service-oriented approach
to linking software systems

3
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:08,800
and applications is transforming
the way many organizations

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,420
share data.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,470
This approach improves
existing methods

6
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,430
of data sharing by providing a
service layer between systems.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,350
Sharing data
between applications

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,530
is a well-established principle
that works on a simple level.

9
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,570
As systems expand,
the solution that

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,900
connects two
software applications

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,070
will often not work for a third.

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,220
What began as a
workable system then

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,350
locks valuable data in a silo.

14
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,570
Sharing the data is still
possible but requires

15
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,122
adaptations and tweaks.

16
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:46,590
The process is laborious
and time-consuming,

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,380
leading to bottlenecks
and overload.

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,930
The reality of this world is
unnecessary effort expended

19
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,760
in duplication of data.

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,360

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,840
By applying a service
layer to the applications

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,350
you wish to connect
up, data is offered out

23
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,210
in a common format
for reuse elsewhere.

24
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,450
The service-oriented approach
works with existing software

25
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,920
systems and does not
require you to remove

26
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,090
the monolithic application.

27
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,710
Placement applications
reuse the links already

28
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,080
made and can plug
into the service layer

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,290
without affecting
other users of data.

30
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,290
New applications can be
added to grow overall system

31
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,270
architectures in the same way.

32
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,070
The data in each
application is offered up

33
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,350
as a service, which any other
application can consume.

34
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,830
When the
service-oriented approach

35
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,310
has evolved into a
system-wide architecture,

36
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,560
it allows connections and
service sharing opportunities

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,195
between organizations
nationally and globally.

38
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:49,470

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,810
Take monitoring of student
progress, for example.

40
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,780
Results are locked by a
virtual learning environment,

41
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,740
but how much of that data is
shared with the management

42
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,980
system that is tracking
progression against funding?

43
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,780
If the motivation and commitment
of struggling students

44
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,690
is not addressed, and
they decide to walk away,

45
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,450
there is a direct
impact on funding.

46
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,110
If the data is freed up and
shared across a system using

47
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,420
a service-oriented
approach, it could

48
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,130
contribute to retaining
student motivation,

49
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,885
and thereby maximizing income.

50
00:02:21,885 --> 00:02:27,220

51
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,630
And what if across the
education community

52
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,690
there was one standard
and agreed way

53
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,490
to describe a course?

54
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,040
It would allow
course information

55
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,450
to be made available
as a consumable service

56
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,580
both internally and externally.

57
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,910
This is the subject of
a current project called

58
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,660
exchanging course-related
information,

59
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,940
or XCII, encompassing course
marketing, quality assurance,

60
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,170
enrollment, and
reporting requirements.

61
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,300
This service-oriented
approach enables

62
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,240
aggregated organizations like
UCast to gather the standard

63
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,050
and agreed descriptions of
courses from each provider.

64
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,530
Comprehensive details
of approved enrollment

65
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,780
opportunities are then returned
to a prospective student

66
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,680
for easy and
accurate comparison.

67
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,940

68
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,040
Amongst the research community,
it is the same principle.

69
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,910
Here, the
service-oriented approach

70
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,360
is enabling researchers to
work across institutions

71
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,960
in virtual organizations.

72
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,430
myGrid is a project that
provides a shared tool

73
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,230
kit for creating experiments
by coordinating the information

74
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,350
flow between distributed
resources and services.

75
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,960
Workflows and query
specifications

76
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,260
link together remote
and local resources

77
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,980
using web service protocols.

78
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,690
Workflows created
by myGrid represent

79
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,470
the scientific process of
the experiments they enact,

80
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,060
making them a rich resource
for scientists creating

81
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,990
their own new experiments.

82
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:58,180
The service lab to
this data enables

83
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,920
users to share, reuse,
and repurpose experiments

84
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,110
within the myGrid community.

85
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:13,630

86
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,415
Many education and
research services

87
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:18,769
are already developing a
service-oriented approach,

88
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,720
taking their lead from
the business world

89
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,140
and major software developers.

90
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,800
It is in this context
that the e-Framework,

91
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,130
a successful and expanding
international initiative,

92
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,240
works to make sense of the
service-oriented approach

93
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,840
for the education and
research community.

94
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,940
The e-Framework website
identifies and describes

95
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,070
the service components needed.

96
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,670
It provides the blueprints
and reference examples

97
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,390
for those in the community
who want to gain a greater

98
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,190
understanding and knowledge
of how to implement

99
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,930
a service-oriented approach.

100
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,170
The e-Framework website is
thus becoming a knowledge base

101
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,720
that is developing
a shared vocabulary

102
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,810
and way of thinking for all
in education and research.

103
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:15,883
