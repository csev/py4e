1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,710

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,810
OK, so welcome to our
BerryBoot start-up video.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:08,560
This is a video that
shows what happens

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,490
once you have prepared your SD
card with a BerryBoot image.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,450
And so I'm about
to plug-- I've got

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,690
my SD card already plugged in.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:20,270
And so I'm about to
plug in my Raspberry Pi.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,959
And you will watch it
from the beginning.

9
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:23,875
So that's a good sign.

10
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:26,480

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,100
And so up we come.

12
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,306
And so the first thing it
asks-- this is BerryBoot now.

13
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:33,430
And one of the things that's
important to configure

14
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:37,970
in a Raspberry Pi
is the overscan.

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,850
And so it's showing
us some green lines.

16
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,374
And do you see
the green borders?

17
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:45,540
Now you're actually supposed
to see at the top here,

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,200
you're supposed to see a
little black outside the green.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,350
So what we want to
say is we want to say,

20
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,570
do we see the green borders?

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,970
We want to say, no, we don't.

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:53,840
OK?

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,690
And so that give us a
little more edge here.

24
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,190
So we'll say, no, we don't.

25
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,420
And we're going to have a
wired network connection.

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,230
The Raspberry Pi doesn't
come with a Wi-Fi,

27
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:07,330
and so we have to use the
wired network connection.

28
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,110
OK.

29
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,280
And so up we go.

30
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,980
And we're going to format it.

31
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:19,220

32
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,290
So now what it's doing is
it's copying the files that we

33
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,430
put on originally
and reformatting

34
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:28,680
it to be the operating
system that it needs to be.

35
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,730
So this takes a minute.

36
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:42,510

37
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,300
OK, so now we're in good shape.

38
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,650
It has connected to the
network and found out

39
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,289
a series of distributions
that you could install.

40
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,830
We're going to choose
this first one,

41
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,496
but we'll first scroll
through so we can

42
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,070
take a look at the other ones.

43
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:56,240
There's various things.

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,660
There's things that
are aimed at children.

45
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,420
There's one laptop per child.

46
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,629
There's a special web server.

47
00:02:02,629 --> 00:02:04,003
But really what
we're going to do

48
00:02:04,003 --> 00:02:05,950
is we're going to put
a basic Linux on it,

49
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,190
a basic Debian Linux.

50
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,699
So we're going to
click here and say OK.

51
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:13,494
Now this is a point where if
your network wasn't working,

52
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:16,160
you would have to be solving the
problem of getting your network

53
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,490
working.

54
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,620
But our network is working.

55
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,352
So here we go.

56
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:21,560
And so this download is
going to take a little while.

57
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,070
So I'm going to skip to the very
end because it's 451 megabytes.

58
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,830
It's going to take
about 12 minutes.

59
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:37,570

60
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,620
So there we go.

61
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,740
We have installed it.

62
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,990
This is the one we want.

63
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,700
We're going to make
it the default.

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,610
And then we are going to
exit to reboot the system.

65
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,680
So it's going to reboot
now, flashy, flashy.

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,530
And now it's booting
again, starting back up.

67
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,286
And the fact that--
we'll speed it up.

68
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:05,160
We can go back to this
Edit menu at any time.

69
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,340
This is really nice.

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,880
This Edit menu
allows you to make

71
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,167
changes, an important thing.

72
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,750
If you're having
trouble, for example,

73
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,710
there are some advanced
configurations here.

74
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,540

75
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,120
And things like if you've
got your overscan wrong,

76
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,390
there's config.txt.

77
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,480
You might set an
overscan value in here.

78
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,170
But we've already set that.

79
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,890
So we're going to
leave this alone.

80
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:32,882
And so now we'll just
have to exit this again,

81
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:33,840
and it'll reboot again.

82
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,927
But you can always
stop the boot.

83
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:38,510
That's one nice thing
about BerryBoot.

84
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,420
We're rebooting.

85
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,410
There we are.

86
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,900
And so you can always
stop and restart.

87
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,020
And it gives you 10 seconds
to interrupt the process,

88
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,870
to install a new
operating system.

89
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,269
But once I let this expire, it
will actually boot the Linux.

90
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:54,560
And you'll see the Linux start.

91
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,990
So the Linux is starting.

92
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,710
Now, the overscan has been
fixed because you can actually

93
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,950
see the characters.

94
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:04,170
If you can't see
the characters, that

95
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,030
means that you didn't set
your overscan correctly.

96
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:10,820
All this text that you're seeing
is Unix or Linux starting up.

97
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,649
And it doesn't matter too much.

98
00:04:13,649 --> 00:04:15,440
The first time it takes
a little bit longer

99
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,910
to start things up
than other times.

100
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,560
After a while, things
will make sense to you.

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,850
You'll get used to it.

102
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,350
It's kind of like in
the movie The Matrix,

103
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,380
after a while, it all
makes sense to you.

104
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,072
But this is just the
operating system starting up.

105
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:31,530
All operating
systems, whether they

106
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:35,300
be Windows or Unix or
Macintosh, they all

107
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,390
do something like this.

108
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,840
They just don't show
you all the details.

109
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,580
Part of the goal
of the Raspberry Pi

110
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,760
is to show you the details,
let you see what's going on,

111
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,210
what you learn from this.

112
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,969
For now you can ignore it.

113
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:49,010
After a while, this might
make more sense to you.

114
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:55,030

115
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,270
Now, you'll notice
it got an IP address.

116
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,560
That's important.

117
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,049
That means that the network
is properly working.

118
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,590
So I'm going to go
down, and here you

119
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,181
have a config screen that
we'll only show once.

120
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:07,180
And I'm just going to
make sure that we're going

121
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,070
to start the desktop on boot.

122
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,120
So I'm using my cursor
keys to do this.

123
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,550
I'm going to select
Boot Behavior.

124
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,050
And I want to boot
straight to desktop.

125
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,490
So is says Yes.

126
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:21,150
So I'm going to say-- I'm going
to hit Enter to store that.

127
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,900
OK?

128
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,275
And now I'm going
to cursor down.

129
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:25,910

130
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,160
And I'm a cursor to the
right and say Finish.

131
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,076
And this is going
to reboot it again.

132
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:33,200
Would I like to reboot now?

133
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,285
And I'll hit Enter again.

134
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:44,030

135
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,910
So it's now restarting.

136
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,880
See the flashing thing?

137
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,100
That flashy really just
means no video signal.

138
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,690
And so up we come this time.

139
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,550
Again, BerryBoot is
starting, giving us

140
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,570
a chance to change
our configuration,

141
00:05:58,570 --> 00:05:59,970
our low level configuration.

142
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,780
If you ever get in
trouble, you can always

143
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:06,360
unplug and plug your Raspberry
Pi back in and you'll see that.

144
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,450
And you have 10 seconds to go
into the Configuration menu.

145
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,830
So now we're starting up again.

146
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,280
This is Linux starting up again.

147
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:30,800

148
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,530
OK, so now what's
happening is it's

149
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,650
going to take a moment
while our desktop starts.

150
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,960
It's totally black.

151
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,970
That's normal.

152
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,430
It'll always do this.

153
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,440
Take a moment.

154
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,730
Be patient.

155
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,110
Our cursor shows up and a
Raspberry Pi logo shows up.

156
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,250
So this is all a very good sign.

157
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,840
So now I can move
my mouse around.

158
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,486
It's a familiar
Windows-like environment.

159
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:52,860
Now, the first
thing I like to do

160
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,670
is I'd like to check
to see the overscan.

161
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,240
So move your cursor
up to the top.

162
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,890
Move your cursor to the left.

163
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,470
If it can't go any
farther that means

164
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,511
that the edge of the screen
and the edge of mouse

165
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:02,710
is exactly right.

166
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,880
Come down to the bottom.

167
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,030
That's good.

168
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,640
Now, if you go to
the upper right,

169
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,900
you'll notice the mouse
kind of disappears,

170
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,165
but it's just off the screen.

171
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:11,610
So that's OK.

172
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,445
That's just fine.

173
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:13,570
So now we're in good shape.

174
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,670
So we have our
overscan set properly.

175
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,940
We're in great shape.

176
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,780
This is like most
operating systems.

177
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,550
It has a Start menu.

178
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,500
OK.

179
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,067
And the question,
of course, is now

180
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,650
what do you do with
your Raspberry Pi?

181
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,270
And since I'm a
Python teacher, I'm

182
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:37,110
going to write a simple
Python program using IDLE.

183
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,790
So IDLE is an interactive
development environment

184
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,070
for Python.

185
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,940
Now I clicked on it.

186
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,210
It will take a moment.

187
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,110
These things aren't the fastest.

188
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,350
It's OK.

189
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,120
And so here I have IDLE.

190
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,772
Let me make the screen
a little smaller.

191
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:53,450
Shew.

192
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,677
I'm going to start a new window.

193
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:00,510
And then this is going
to be where I'm going

194
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,290
to write my Python program.

195
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:11,590
And I'm going to say the
classic print, "Hello world."

196
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:16,720
And I'm going to save
this, File, Save As.

197
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,435
I'm going to put it on
my desktop as hello.py.

198
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:27,220

199
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,790
This is a traditional first
programming assignment,

200
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,180
"Hello world."

201
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,850
And really, it's not
really the computer

202
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,100
saying "Hello world" to you.

203
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,640
It's you inside the computer
saying "Hello world" back

204
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,880
to yourself.

205
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,760
Because the computer really
does nothing except what

206
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,570
you tell it to.

207
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,500
So this is our Python program.

208
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,360
And I'm going to run the
Python program, run the module.

209
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
And there we go. "Hello world."

210
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,950
So this "Hello
world" came from you.

211
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:06,320
I will change this.

212
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:17,150
I will say, "Hello world-- this
is Chuck inside a Raspberry

213
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,921
Pi."

214
00:09:18,921 --> 00:09:20,710
Oops, I got a typo there.

215
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,494

216
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:27,035
Let me make my window bigger so
you can see my whole program.

217
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:39,970

218
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,980
"Hello world-- this is Chuck
inside a Raspberry Pi."

219
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,700
Remember, the
reason we do this is

220
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,480
it's because we're making the
Raspberry Pi do our bidding.

221
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,340
And our first thing to do as
a human inside of a computer

222
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,140
is to tell the world hello
from within the computer.

223
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,350
Run module.

224
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,680
Yes, of course I'll save it.

225
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,810
Here we come.

226
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:08,820
"Hello world-- this is Chuck
inside a Raspberry Pi."

227
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,410
OK, so, I'll close these.

228
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,050
And you'll notice that
sitting on my desktop

229
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,840
is a new file called hello.py.

230
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,910
And that's my little
program that I

231
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:23,930
added to my Raspberry Pi, the
first thing that I did it.

232
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:27,880
So a couple things--
you got a Start menu.

233
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,160
And Log Out is where
you would shut down.

234
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,020
There's other tools, very many
things inside of a Raspberry

235
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,700
Pi.

236
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,158
But what we're
going to do is we're

237
00:10:35,158 --> 00:10:36,480
going to simply shut this down.

238
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,900

239
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,550
It brings up.

240
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,080
Do you want to reboot it,
which you can or shut down.

241
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,766
Shut down will shut it
down and power it off.

242
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,140
And once you shut
it down, you're

243
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,840
going to have to unplug and plug
it back in to start it back up.

244
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,810
So there we go.

245
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,190
Now, as it shuts down, we'll
see a couple of messages again.

246
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,600
It's going to shut down.

247
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,960
Shut down, shut down.

248
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,870
And now it's finishing,
and our video

249
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,220
is going to go away
because we're all done.

250
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,850
And at this point, you might as
well unplug your Raspberry Pi.

251
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:18,974
