This PR contains the complete translation of 'Python for Everybody' book from English to Filipino-English (Taglish). All 16 chapters plus preface, contributions, and copyright sections have been translated. The translation maintains technical accuracy while using natural Taglish expressions to make Python programming concepts accessible to Filipino readers.

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, Dr Chuck (@csev). It's been a while. At last, after a year, I think I managed to get a good initial version of PY4E's filipino translation. To be honest, I managed to directly edit it in your codebase because of Cursor. Hope this can make it to the list of translations. I am planning to continue using PY4E as the basis on teaching basic Python particularly for Filipinos in the Philippines. Thanks again.
