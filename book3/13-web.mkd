Using Web Services
==================

Once it became easy to retrieve documents and parse documents over HTTP
using programs, it did not take long to develop an approach where we
started producing documents that were specifically designed to be
consumed by other programs (i.e., not HTML to be displayed in a
browser).

There are two common formats that we use when exchanging data across the
web. eXtensible Markup Language (XML) has been in use for a very
long time and is best suited for exchanging document-style data. When
programs just want to exchange dictionaries, lists, or other internal
information with each other, they use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
(see [www.json.org](http://www.json.org)). We will look at both formats.

eXtensible Markup Language - XML
--------------------------------

XML looks very similar to HTML, but XML is more structured than HTML.
Here is a sample of an XML document:

~~~~ {.xml}
<person>
  <name>Chuck</name>
  <phone type="intl">
    +1 734 303 4456
  </phone>
  <email hide="yes" />
</person>
~~~~

Each pair of opening (e.g., `<person>`) and closing tags
(e.g., `</person>`) represents a *element* or *node* with the same
name as the tag (e.g., `person`). Each element can have some text,
some attributes (e.g., `hide`), and other nested elements. If an XML
element is empty (i.e., has no content), then it may be depicted by
a self-closing tag (e.g., `<email />`).

Often it is helpful to think of an XML document as a tree structure
where there is a top element (here: `person`), and other tags (e.g.,
`phone`) are drawn as *children* of their *parent* elements.

![A Tree Representation of XML](height=2.0in@../images/xml-tree)

Parsing XML
-----------

\index{ElementTree}
\index{ElementTree!fromstring}
\index{ElementTree!find}

Here is a simple application that parses some XML and extracts some data
elements from the XML:

\VerbatimInput{../code3/xml1.py} 

The triple single quote (`'''`), as well as the triple double quote (`"""`), allow for the creation of strings that span multiple lines.

Calling `fromstring` converts the string representation of
the XML into a "tree" of XML elements. When the XML is in a tree,
we have a series of methods we can call to extract portions
of data from the XML string.  The `find` function searches
through the XML tree and retrieves the element that matches
the specified tag.

~~~~
Name: Chuck
Attr: yes
~~~~

Using an XML parser such as `ElementTree` has the advantage
that while the XML in this example is quite simple, it turns out there
are many rules regarding valid XML, and using `ElementTree`
allows us to extract data from XML without worrying about the rules of
XML syntax.

Looping through nodes
---------------------

\index{ElementTree!findall}
\index{ElementTree!get}

Often the XML has multiple nodes and we need to write a loop to process
all of the nodes. In the following program, we loop through all of the
`user` nodes:

\VerbatimInput{../code3/xml2.py} 

The `findall` method retrieves a Python list of subtrees that
represent the `user` structures in the XML tree. Then we can
write a `for` loop that looks at each of the user nodes, and
prints the `name` and `id` text elements as well
as the `x` attribute from the `user` node.

~~~~
User count: 2
Name Chuck
Id 001
Attribute 2
Name Brent
Id 009
Attribute 7
~~~~

It is important to include all parent level elements in the `findall`
statement except for the top level element (e.g., `users/user`).
Otherwise, Python will not find any desired nodes.

~~~~ {.python}
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

input = '''
<stuff>
  <users>
    <user x="2">
      <id>001</id>
      <name>Chuck</name>
    </user>
    <user x="7">
      <id>009</id>
      <name>Brent</name>
    </user>
  </users>
</stuff>'''

stuff = ET.fromstring(input)

lst = stuff.findall('users/user')
print('User count:', len(lst))

lst2 = stuff.findall('user')
print('User count:', len(lst2))
~~~~

`lst` stores all `user` elements that are nested within their `users`
parent. `lst2` looks for `user` elements that are not nested within
the top level `stuff` element where there are none.

~~~~
User count: 2
User count: 0
~~~~

JavaScript Object Notation - JSON
---------------------------------

\index{JSON}
\index{JavaScript Object Notation}

The JSON format was inspired by the object and array format used in the
JavaScript language. But since Python was invented before JavaScript,
Python's syntax for dictionaries and lists influenced the syntax of
JSON. So the format of JSON is nearly identical to a combination of
Python lists and dictionaries.

Here is a JSON encoding that is roughly equivalent to the simple XML
from above:

~~~~ {.json}
{
  "name" : "Chuck",
  "phone" : {
    "type" : "intl",
    "number" : "+1 734 303 4456"
   },
   "email" : {
     "hide" : "yes"
   }
}
~~~~

You will notice some differences. First, in XML, we can add attributes
like "intl" to the "phone" tag. In JSON, we simply have key-value pairs.
Also the XML "person" tag is gone, replaced by a set of outer curly
braces.

In general, JSON structures are simpler than XML because JSON has fewer
capabilities than XML. But JSON has the advantage that it maps
*directly* to some combination of dictionaries and lists.
And since nearly all programming languages have something equivalent to
Python's dictionaries and lists, JSON is a very natural format to have
two cooperating programs exchange data.

JSON is quickly becoming the format of choice for nearly all data
exchange between applications because of its relative simplicity
compared to XML.

Parsing JSON
------------

We construct our JSON by nesting dictionaries and lists as
needed. In this example, we represent a list of users where each user is
a set of key-value pairs (i.e., a dictionary). So we have a list of
dictionaries.

In the following program, we use the built-in `json`
library to parse the JSON and read through the data. Compare this
closely to the equivalent XML data and code above. The JSON has less
detail, so we must know in advance that we are getting a list and that
the list is of users and each user is a set of key-value pairs. The JSON
is more succinct (an advantage) but also is less self-describing (a
disadvantage).

\VerbatimInput{../code3/json2.py}

If you compare the code to extract data from the parsed JSON and XML you
will see that what we get from `json.loads()` is a Python
list which we traverse with a `for` loop, and each item
within that list is a Python dictionary. Once the JSON has been parsed,
we can use the Python index operator to extract the various bits of data
for each user. We don't have to use the JSON library to dig through the
parsed JSON, since the returned data is simply native Python structures.

The output of this program is exactly the same as the XML version above.

~~~~
User count: 2
Name Chuck
Id 001
Attribute 2
Name Brent
Id 009
Attribute 7
~~~~

In general, there is an industry trend away from XML and towards JSON
for web services. Because the JSON is simpler and more directly maps to
native data structures we already have in programming languages, the
parsing and data extraction code is usually simpler and more direct when
using JSON. But XML is more self-descriptive than JSON and so there are
some applications where XML retains an advantage. For example, most word
processors store documents internally using XML rather than JSON.

Application Programming Interfaces
----------------------------------

We now have the ability to exchange data between applications using
HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) and a way to represent complex data
that we are sending back and forth between these applications using
eXtensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

The next step is to begin to define and document "contracts" between
applications using these techniques. The general name for these
application-to-application contracts is *Application Program
Interfaces* (APIs). When we use an API, generally one program
makes a set of *services* available for use by other
applications and publishes the APIs (i.e., the "rules") that must be
followed to access the services provided by the program.

When we begin to build our programs where the functionality of our
program includes access to services provided by other programs, we call
the approach a *Service-oriented architecture* (SOA). A
SOA approach is one where our overall application makes use of the
services of other applications. A non-SOA approach is where the
application is a single standalone application which contains all of the
code necessary to implement the application.

We see many examples of SOA when we use the web. We can go to a single
web site and book air travel, hotels, and automobiles all from a single
site. The data for hotels is not stored on the airline computers.
Instead, the airline computers contact the services on the hotel
computers and retrieve the hotel data and present it to the user. When
the user agrees to make a hotel reservation using the airline site, the
airline site uses another web service on the hotel systems to actually
make the reservation. And when it comes time to charge your credit card
for the whole transaction, still other computers become involved in the
process.

![Service-oriented architecture](height=3.0in@../images/soa)

A Service-oriented architecture has many advantages, including: (1) we
always maintain only one copy of data (this is particularly important
for things like hotel reservations where we do not want to over-commit)
and (2) the owners of the data can set the rules about the use of their
data. With these advantages, an SOA system must be carefully designed to
have good performance and meet the user's needs.

When an application makes a set of services in its API available over
the web, we call these *web services*.

Security and API usage
----------------------

\index{OAuth}
\index{API!key}

It is quite common that you need an API key to make use of a
vendor's API. The general idea is that they want to know who is using
their services and how much each user is using. Perhaps they have free
and pay tiers of their services or have a policy that limits the number
of requests that a single individual can make during a particular time
period.

Sometimes once you get your API key, you simply include the key as part
of POST data or perhaps as a parameter on the URL when calling the API.

Other times, the vendor wants increased assurance of the source of the
requests and so they expect you to send cryptographically signed
messages using shared keys and secrets. A very common technology that is
used to sign requests over the Internet is called
*OAuth*. You can read more about the OAuth protocol at
[www.oauth.net](http://www.oauth.net).

Thankfully there are a number of convenient
and free OAuth libraries so you can avoid writing an OAuth
implementation from scratch by reading the specification. These
libraries are of varying complexity and have varying degrees of
richness. The OAuth web site has information about various OAuth
libraries.

Google geocoding web service
----------------------------

\index{Google}
\index{geocoding}
\index{web service}

Google has an excellent web service that allows us to make use of their
large database of geographic information. We can submit a geographical
search string like "Ann Arbor, MI" to their geocoding API and have
Google return its best guess as to where on a map we might find our
search string and tell us about the landmarks nearby.

The geocoding service is free but rate limited so you cannot make
unlimited use of the API in a commercial application. But if you have
some survey data where an end user has entered a location in a
free-format input box, you can use this API to clean up your data quite
nicely.

*When you are using a free API like Google's geocoding API, you
need to be respectful in your use of these resources. If too many people
abuse the service, Google might drop or significantly curtail its free
service.*

\index{rate limiting}

You can read the online documentation for this service, but it is quite
simple and you can even test it using a browser by typing the following
URL into your browser:

[http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Ann+Arbor%2C+MI](http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Ann+Arbor%2C+MI)

Make sure to unwrap the URL and remove any spaces from the URL before
pasting it into your browser.

The following is a simple application to prompt the user for a search
string, call the Google geocoding API, and extract information from the
returned JSON.

\VerbatimInput{../code3/geojson.py} 

The program takes the search string and constructs a URL with the search
string as a properly encoded parameter and then uses
`urllib` to retrieve the text from the Google geocoding
API. Unlike a fixed web page, the data we get depends on the parameters
we send and the geographical data stored in Google's servers.

Once we retrieve the JSON data, we parse it with the
`json` library and do a few checks to make sure that we
received good data, then extract the information that we are looking
for.

Note that we use our own copy of some of the Google data to avoid rate limits
and key requirements.

The output of the program is as follows (some of the returned JSON has
been removed):

~~~~
