Tuples
======

Tuples are immutable
--------------------

\index{tuple}
\index{type!tuple}
\index{sequence}

A tuple^[Fun fact: The word "tuple" comes from the names given to sequences
of numbers of varying lengths: single, double, triple, quadruple,
quintuple, sextuple, septuple, etc.] is a sequence of values much like a list. The values stored
in a tuple can be any type, and they are indexed by integers. The
important difference is that tuples are *immutable*.
Tuples are also *comparable* and
*hashable* so we can sort lists of them and use tuples as
key values in Python dictionaries.

\index{mutability}
\index{hashable}
\index{comparable}
\index{immutability}

Syntactically, a tuple is a comma-separated list of values:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> t = 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'
~~~~

Although it is not necessary, it is common to enclose tuples in
parentheses to help us quickly identify tuples when we look at Python
code:

\index{parentheses!tuples in}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
~~~~

To create a tuple with a single element, you have to include the final
comma:

\index{singleton}
\index{tuple!singleton}

~~~~ {.python .trinket}
>>> t1 = ('a',)
>>> type(t1)
<type 'tuple'>
~~~~

Without the comma Python treats `('a')` as an expression with a string
in parentheses that evaluates to a string:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> t2 = ('a')
>>> type(t2)
<type 'str'>
~~~~

Another way to construct a tuple is the built-in function
`tuple`. With no argument, it creates an empty tuple:

\index{tuple function}
\index{function!tuple}

~~~~ {.python .trinket}
>>> t = tuple()
>>> print(t)
()
~~~~

If the argument is a sequence (string, list, or tuple), the result of
the call to `tuple` is a tuple with the elements of the
sequence:

~~~~ {.python .trinket}
>>> t = tuple('lupins')
>>> print(t)
('l', 'u', 'p', 'i', 'n', 's')
~~~~

Because `tuple` is the name of a constructor, you should
avoid using it as a variable name.

Most list operators also work on tuples. The bracket operator indexes an
element:

\index{bracket operator}
\index{operator!bracket}

~~~~ {.python .trinket}
>>> t = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
>>> print(t[0])
'a'
~~~~

And the slice operator selects a range of elements.

\index{slice operator}
\index{operator!slice}
\index{tuple!slice}
\index{slice!tuple}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> print(t[1:3])
('b', 'c')
~~~~

But if you try to modify one of the elements of the tuple, you get an
error:

\index{exception!TypeError}
\index{TypeError}
\index{item assignment}
\index{assignment!item}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> t[0] = 'A'
TypeError: object doesn't support item assignment
~~~~

You can't modify the elements of a tuple, but you can replace one tuple
with another:

~~~~ {.python .trinket}
>>> t = ('A',) + t[1:]
>>> print(t)
('A', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
~~~~

Comparing tuples
----------------

\index{comparison!tuple}
\index{tuple!comparison}
\index{sort method}
\index{method!sort}

The comparison operators work with tuples and other sequences. Python
starts by comparing the first element from each sequence. If they are
equal, it goes on to the next element, and so on, until it finds
elements that differ. Subsequent elements are not considered (even if
they are really big).

~~~~ {.python .trinket}
>>> (0, 1, 2) < (0, 3, 4)
True
>>> (0, 1, 2000000) < (0, 3, 4)
True
~~~~

The `sort` function works the same way. It sorts primarily by
first element, but in the case of a tie, it sorts by second element, and
so on.

This feature lends itself to a pattern called *DSU* for

Decorate
:   a sequence by building a list of tuples with one or more sort keys
    preceding the elements from the sequence,

Sort
:   the list of tuples using the Python built-in `sort`, and

Undecorate
:   by extracting the sorted elements of the sequence.

\index{DSU pattern}
\index{pattern!DSU}
\index{decorate-sort-undecorate pattern}
\index{pattern!decorate-sort-undecorate}
\index{Romeo and Juliet}

For example, suppose you have a list of words and you want to sort them
from longest to shortest:

\VerbatimInput{../code3/soft.py} 

The first loop builds a list of tuples, where each tuple is a word
preceded by its length.

`sort` compares the first element, length, first, and only
considers the second element to break ties. The keyword argument
`reverse=True` tells `sort` to go in decreasing
order.

\index{keyword argument}
\index{argument!keyword}
\index{traversal}

The second loop traverses the list of tuples and builds a list of words
in descending order of length. The four-character words are sorted in
*reverse* alphabetical order, so "what" appears before
"soft" in the following list.

The output of the program is as follows:

~~~~
['yonder', 'window', 'breaks', 'light', 'what',
'soft', 'but', 'in']
~~~~

Of course the line loses much of its poetic impact when turned into a
Python list and sorted in descending word length order.

Tuple assignment
----------------

\index{tuple!assignment}
\index{assignment!tuple}
\index{swap pattern}
\index{pattern!swap}

One of the unique syntactic features of the Python language is the 
ability to have a tuple on the left side and a sequence on the right side of an assignment statement. 
This allows you to assign more than one variable at a time to the given sequence.

In this example we have a two-element tuple and
assign the first and second elements of the tuple to the variables
`x` and `y` in a single statement.

~~~~ {.python .trinket}
>>> m = ( 'have', 'fun' )
>>> x, y = m
>>> x
'have'
>>> y
'fun'
>>>
~~~~

This is more general than tuple-to-tuple assignment.  Both tuples and lists
are sequences, so this syntax works with a two element list as well.

~~~~ {.python .trinket}
>>> m = [ 'have', 'fun' ]
>>> x, y = m
>>> x
'have'
>>> y
'fun'
>>>
~~~~

It is not magic, Python *roughly* translates the tuple assignment syntax
to be the following:^[Python does not translate the syntax literally. For example, if
you try this with a dictionary, it will not work as you might expect.]

~~~~ {.python .trinket}
>>> m = ( 'have', 'fun' )
>>> x = m[0]
>>> y = m[1]
>>> x
'have'
>>> y
'fun'
>>>
~~~~

Stylistically when we use a tuple on the left side of the assignment
statement, we omit the parentheses, but the following is an equally
valid syntax:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> m = ( 'have', 'fun' )
>>> (x, y) = m
>>> x
'have'
>>> y
'fun'
>>>
~~~~

A particularly clever application of tuple assignment allows us to
*swap* the values of two variables in a single statement:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> a, b = b, a
~~~~

Both sides of this statement are tuples, but the left side is a tuple of
variables; the right side is a tuple of expressions. Each value on the
right side is assigned to its respective variable on the left side. All
the expressions on the right side are evaluated before any of the
assignments.

The number of variables on the left and the number of values on the
right must be the same:

\index{exception!ValueError}
\index{ValueError}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> a, b = 1, 2, 3
ValueError: too many values to unpack
~~~~

More generally, the right side can be any kind of sequence (string,
list, or tuple). For example, to split an email address into a user name
and a domain, you could write:

\index{split method}
\index{method!split}
\index{email address}

~~~~ {.python}
>>> addr = 'monty@python.org'
>>> uname, domain = addr.split('@')
~~~~

The return value from `split` is a list with two elements;
the first element is assigned to `uname`, the second to
`domain`.

~~~~ {.python}
>>> print(uname)
monty
>>> print(domain)
python.org
~~~~

Dictionaries and tuples
-----------------------

\index{dictionary}
\index{items method}
\index{method!items}
\index{key-value pair}

Dictionaries have a method called `items` that returns a list
of tuples, where each tuple is a key-value pair:

~~~~ {.python .trinket}
>>> d = {'b':1, 'a':10, 'c':22}
>>> t = list(d.items())
>>> print(t)
[('b', 1), ('a', 10), ('c', 22)]
~~~~

As you should expect from a dictionary, the items are in non-alphabetical
order.

However, since the list of tuples is a list, and tuples are comparable,
we can now sort the list of tuples. Converting a dictionary to a list of
tuples is a way for us to output the contents of a dictionary sorted by
key:

~~~~ {.python}
>>> d = {'b':1, 'a':10, 'c':22}
>>> t = list(d.items())
>>> t
[('b', 1), ('a', 10), ('c', 22)]
>>> t.sort()
>>> t
[('a', 10), ('b', 1), ('c', 22)]
~~~~

The list of tuples is now sorted in ascending alphabetical order by the key.

Multiple assignment with dictionaries
-------------------------------------

\index{traverse!dictionary}
\index{dictionary!traversal}

Combining `items`, tuple assignment, and `for`,
you can see a nice code pattern for traversing the keys and values of a
dictionary in a single loop:

~~~~ {.python}
d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
for key, val in d.items():
    print(val, key)
~~~~

This loop has two *iteration variables* because
`items` returns a list of tuples and `key, val` is
a tuple assignment that successively iterates through each of the
key-value pairs in the dictionary.

For each iteration through the loop, both `key` and
`val` are advanced to the next key-value pair in the
dictionary (still in hash order).

The output of this loop is:

~~~~
10 a
1 b
22 c
~~~~

Again, it is in hash key order (i.e., no particular order).

If we combine these two techniques, we can print out the contents of a
dictionary sorted by the *value* stored in each key-value pair.

To do this, we first make a list of tuples where each tuple is
`(value, key)`. The `items` method would give us a
list of `(key, value)` tuples, but this time we want to sort
by value, not key. Once we have constructed the list with the value-key
tuples, it is a simple matter to sort the list in reverse order and
print it out.

~~~~ {.python}
>>> d = {'a':10, 'b':1, 'c':22}
>>> l = list()
>>> for key, val in d.items() :
...     l.append( (val, key) )
...
>>> l
[(10, 'a'), (1, 'b'), (22, 'c')]
>>> l.sort(reverse=True)
>>> l
[(22, 'c'), (10, 'a'), (1, 'b')]
>>>
~~~~

By carefully constructing the list of tuples to have the value as the
first element of each tuple, we can sort the list of tuples and print our
dictionary contents sorted by value.

The most common words
---------------------

\index{Romeo and Juliet}

Coming back to our running example of the text from *Romeo and Juliet*
Act 2, Scene 2, we can augment our program to use this technique to
print the ten most common words in the text as follows:

\VerbatimInput{../code3/count3.py} 
\begin{trinketfiles}
../code3/romeo-full.txt
\end{trinketfiles}

The first part of the program which reads the file and computes the
dictionary that maps each word to the count of words in the document is
unchanged. But instead of simply printing out `counts` and
ending the program, we construct a list of `(val, key)`
tuples and then sort the list in reverse order.

Since the value is first, it will be used for the comparisons. If there
is more than one tuple with the same value, it will look at the second
element (the key), so tuples where the value is the same will be further
sorted by the alphabetical order of the key.

At the end we write a nice `for` loop which does a multiple
assignment iteration and prints out the ten most common words by
iterating through a slice of the list (`lst[:10]`).

So now the output finally looks like what we want for our word frequency
analysis.

~~~~
61 i
42 and
40 romeo
34 to
34 the
32 thou
32 juliet
30 that
29 my
24 thee
~~~~

The fact that this complex data parsing and analysis can be done with an
easy-to-understand 19-line Python program is one reason why Python is a
good choice as a language for exploring information.

Using tuples as keys in dictionaries
------------------------------------

\index{tuple!as key in dictionary}
\index{hashable}

Because tuples are *hashable* and lists are not, if we
want to create a *composite* key to use in a dictionary
we must use a tuple as the key.

We would encounter a composite key if we wanted to create a telephone
directory that maps from last-name, first-name pairs to telephone
numbers. Assuming that we have defined the variables `last`,
`first`, and `number`, we could write a dictionary
assignment statement as follows:

~~~~ {.python}
directory[last,first] = number
~~~~

The expression in brackets is a tuple. We could use tuple assignment in
a `for` loop to traverse this dictionary.

\index{tuple!in brackets}

~~~~ {.python}
for last, first in directory:
    print(first, last, directory[last,first])
~~~~

This loop traverses the keys in `directory`, which are
tuples. It assigns the elements of each tuple to `last` and
`first`, then prints the name and corresponding telephone
number.

Sequences: strings, lists, and tuples - Oh My!
--------------------------------------------

\index{sequence}

I have focused on lists of tuples, but almost all of the examples in
this chapter also work with lists of lists, tuples of tuples, and tuples
of lists. To avoid enumerating the possible combinations, it is
sometimes easier to talk about sequences of sequences.

In many contexts, the different kinds of sequences (strings, lists, and
tuples) can be used interchangeably. So how and why do you choose one
over the others?

\index{string}
\index{list}
\index{tuple}
\index{mutability}
\index{immutability}

To start with the obvious, strings are more limited than other sequences
because the elements have to be characters. They are also immutable. If
you need the ability to change the characters in a string (as opposed to
creating a new string), you might want to use a list of characters
instead.

Lists are more common than tuples, mostly because they are mutable. But
there are a few cases where you might prefer tuples:

1.  In some contexts, like a `return` statement, it is
    syntactically simpler to create a tuple than a list. In other
    contexts, you might prefer a list.

2.  If you want to use a sequence as a dictionary key, you have to use
    an immutable type like a tuple or string.

3.  If you are passing a sequence as an argument to a function, using
    tuples reduces the potential for unexpected behavior due to
    aliasing.

Because tuples are immutable, they don't provide methods like
`sort` and `reverse`, which modify existing lists.
However Python provides the built-in functions `sorted` and
`reversed`, which take any sequence as a parameter and return
a new sequence with the same elements in a different order.

\index{sorted function}
\index{function!sorted}
\index{reversed function}
\index{function!reversed}

List comprehension
------------------

Sometimes you want to create a sequence by using data from another sequence.
You can achieve this by writing a for loop and appending one item at a time.
For example, if you wanted to convert a list of strings -- each string storing digits
-- into numbers that you can sum up, you would write:

~~~~ {.python}
list_of_ints_in_strings = ['42', '65', '12']
list_of_ints = []
for x in list_of_ints_in_strings:
    list_of_ints.append(int(x))

print(sum(list_of_ints))
~~~~

With list comprehension, the above code can be written in a more compact manner:

~~~~ {.python}
list_of_ints_in_strings = ['42', '65', '12']
list_of_ints = [ int(x) for x in list_of_ints_in_strings ]
print(sum(list_of_ints))
~~~~

Debugging
---------

\index{debugging}
\index{data structure}
\index{shape error}
\index{error!shape}

Lists, dictionaries and tuples are known generically as *data
structures*; in this chapter we are starting to see compound
data structures, like lists of tuples, and dictionaries that contain
tuples as keys and lists as values. Compound data structures are useful,
but they are prone to what I call *shape errors*; that
is, errors caused when a data structure has the wrong type, size, or
composition, or perhaps you write some code and forget the shape of your
data and introduce an error. For example, if you are expecting a list with one integer and I give you a plain old integer (not in a list), it won't work.

Glossary
--------

comparable
:   A type where one value can be checked to see if it is greater than,
    less than, or equal to another value of the same type. Types which
    are comparable can be put in a list and sorted.
\index{comparable}

data structure
:   A collection of related values, often organized in lists,
    dictionaries, tuples, etc.
\index{data structure}

DSU
:   Abbreviation of "decorate-sort-undecorate", a pattern that involves
    building a list of tuples, sorting, and extracting part of the
    result.
\index{DSU pattern}

gather
:   The operation of assembling a variable-length argument tuple.
\index{gather}

hashable
:   A type that has a hash function. Immutable types like integers,
    floats, and strings are hashable; mutable types like lists and
    dictionaries are not.
\index{hashable}

scatter
:   The operation of treating a sequence as a list of arguments.
\index{scatter}

shape (of a data structure)
:   A summary of the type, size, and composition of a data structure.
\index{shape}

singleton
:   A list (or other sequence) with a single element.
\index{singleton}

tuple
:   An immutable sequence of elements.
\index{tuple}

tuple assignment
:   An assignment with a sequence on the right side and a tuple of
    variables on the left. The right side is evaluated and then its
    elements are assigned to the variables on the left.

\index{assignment!tuple}

Exercises
---------

**Exercise 1:** Revise a previous program as follows: Read and parse the
"From " lines and pull out the addresses from the line. Count the number
of messages from each person using a dictionary.

After all the data has been read, print the person with the most commits
by creating a list of (count, email) tuples from the dictionary. Then
sort the list in reverse order and print out the person who has the most
commits.
