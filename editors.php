        <h1>Programming Text Editor</h1>
<p>
You will need a text editor to use to write programs.  In particular, there are
number of editors you <b>should not use</b> for programming including, Microsoft Word,
NotePad, TextEdit or Libre Office.  These editors tend not to store "plain text" which
is how we need to write programs.   Programs cannot have things like bold, italics, or different
fonts - and even if you don't use these things in your file, the files are stored in a format
that can represent all this "pretty" text stuff - and that confuses compilers and interpreters.
</p>
<p>
If you already have an editor or development environment installed please <b>keep using it</b>.
There is no need to install another editor just for this course.
